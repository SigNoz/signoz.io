First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the
[official AWS documentation][1]
for more info). Follow the "Managed nodes - Linux" guide.

<K8sComponents />

## Prerequisites

- Managed nodes - Linux. Fargate is not offically supported
- You must have an EKS cluster

<CommonPrerequisites />

- In case of K8s version `1.23` and above, you must install the Amazon EBS CSI driver
  and provide relevant volume permissions to the role assigned to the Amazon EKS cluster
  IAM role. To know more, refer to the [Amazon EBS CSI migration documentation][2].

## Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `override-values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find
an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under
[chart configuration][3].

```yaml
global:
  storageClass: gp2-resizable
  cloud: aws

clickhouse:
  installCustomStorageClass: true
```

<StorageClass />

## Install SigNoz on Kubernetes with Helm

<InstallSigNozPart1 />

```bash
helm --namespace platform install my-release signoz/signoz -f override-values.yaml
```

<InstallSigNozPart2 />

## Verify the Installation

<VerifyInstallation />

## (Optional) Install a Sample Application and Generate Tracing Data

<K8sHotrod />
