Once you have successfully installed SigNoz on Kubernetes, the following sections
provide an overview of the activities that are required to successfully operate SigNoz.

## Stop/Start SigNoz Cluster

To stop SigNoz cluster:

```bash
helm -n platform uninstall "my-release"
```

To start/resume SigNoz cluster:

```bash
helm -n platform install "my-release"
```

*Note: The newly created release aka SigNoz cluster should mount to
the existing persistent volume as long as the **namespace** and the
**release name** matches the old one.*

## Upgrade SigNoz Cluster

Use the steps below to upgrade to the latest version:

1. Fetch the latest chart information from the Helm repositories
```bash
helm repo update
```

2. Upgrade to the latest available version of the chart
```bash
helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz
```

<UpgradeInfo/>

In case you wish to upgrade the SigNoz cluster to a specific version,
follow the steps below:

1. List the available SigNoz Helm charts with their version and supported app version.
```bash
helm search repo signoz --versions
```

The output should look similar to the following:
```output
NAME               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
signoz/signoz      	0.2.5        	0.10.2     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
signoz/signoz      	0.2.3        	0.10.1     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
signoz/signoz      	0.2.2        	0.10.0     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
signoz/signoz      	0.2.1        	0.10.0     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
signoz/signoz      	0.2.0        	0.10.0     	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
signoz/signoz      	0.1.4        	0.9.2      	SigNoz Observability Platform Helm Chart
signoz/clickhouse  	23.4.0       	22.4.5     	A Helm chart for ClickHouse
signoz/clickhouse  	23.3.3       	22.4.5     	A Helm chart for ClickHouse
```

2. Run the following command to install the chart version `0.2.5` running SigNoz
version `0.10.2` with the release name `my-release` and namespace `platform`:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz --version 0.2.5
```

<UpgradeWarning/>

## Uninstall SigNoz Cluster

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` resources:

```bash
helm -n platform uninstall "my-release"
```

See the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for documentation
on the helm uninstall command.

The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated
with the chart and deletes the release except for ClickHouse CRD resources due to `finalizers`.

To delete resources accociated to `ClickHouseInstallations` instance:

```bash
kubectl -n platform patch \
  clickhouseinstallations.clickhouse.altinity.com/my-release-clickhouse \
  -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
```

Deletion of the StatefulSet doesn't cascade to deleting associated PVCs. To delete them:

```bash
kubectl -n platform delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-release
```

At last, clean up the namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace platform
```

:::info
Replace `my-release` and `platform` from above instructions with appropriate
release name and SigNoz namespace respectively.

## Remove the Sample Application from Dashboard

Use the command below to remove the sample application:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/raw/main/sample-apps/hotrod/hotrod-delete.sh \
  | HOTROD_NAMESPACE=sample-application bash
```
