          1.

          Dynatrace is one of the top APM products. But it’s difficult to navigate its complex
          UI/UX. There is a steep learning curve, and if your company does not have access to its
          full platform plan, the usability reduces.
          <br />
          SigNoz is not gated by any SKU-based subscription. You can access all its features in its
          basic paid plan and pay based only on the amount of data you send.

          ​SigNoz supports OpenTelemetry libraries for application instrumentation. You don’t need
          to install any host-based agents. Using OpenTelemetry libraries gives you the flexibility
          to send data to any backend.
          <br />
          If your use case requires, you can also run the OpenTelemetry collector as an agent to
          collect data.
