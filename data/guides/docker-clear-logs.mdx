Docker container logs can consume disk space rapidly and impact system performance when unmanaged. A single long-running container can generate gigabytes of log data, leading to **"No Space Left on Device"** errors that bring entire systems to a halt. This guide covers proven methods to safely clear Docker logs, implement automated rotation, and prevent future disk space issues.

Whether you're dealing with emergency disk space situations or implementing proactive log management strategies, these solutions address the needs of developers, SREs, platform engineers, and DevOps professionals managing containerized environments.

## Understanding Docker Container Logs

Docker captures all output from containerized applications through `stdout` and `stderr` streams. By default, Docker uses the `json-file` logging driver, storing logs as JSON-formatted files in `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container_id>/<container_id>-json.log` on the host system.

<Figure src="/img/guides/2024/07/docker-clear-logs-Screenshot_2024-07-16_at_5.01.07_AM.webp" alt="Docker logs" caption="Docker logs growing over time can consume significant disk space" />

### The Problem: Uncontrolled Log Growth

Docker logs accumulate indefinitely by default, creating critical issues:

- **Disk exhaustion**: Logs grow from megabytes to gigabytes within days
- **System instability**: 100% disk usage causes container crashes or startup failures
- **Performance degradation**: Large log files slow `docker logs` operations
- **Backup complications**: Massive logs complicate backup and recovery processes

### Docker Log Architecture

Understanding Docker's log handling enables effective management:

1. **Container Output**: Applications write to `stdout` and `stderr`
2. **Logging Driver**: Captures and processes output (default: `json-file`)
3. **Storage Location**: Logs stored in `/var/lib/docker/containers/` directory
4. **Access Method**: Retrieved via `docker logs` command or direct file access

## Method 1: Configure Preventive Log Rotation (Recommended)

The most effective approach prevents excessive log accumulation through proper configuration. Docker's built-in log rotation automatically manages log file sizes before they become problematic.

### Global Docker Daemon Configuration

Configure rotation for all containers by modifying the Docker daemon:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

Add or update the logging configuration:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

This configuration limits log files to 10MB each, keeping a maximum of 3 rotated files per container. The `local` driver provides better performance and automatic compression compared to the traditional `json-file` driver.

Restart Docker to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Per-Container Configuration

For granular control, configure logging when starting containers:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --log-driver=local \
  --log-opt max-size=10m \
  --log-opt max-file=3 \
  nginx:latest
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

Implement log rotation in your `docker-compose.yml` files:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    logging:
      driver: "local"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
  
  database:
    image: postgres:13
    logging:
      driver: "local"
      options:
        max-size: "20m"
        max-file: "5"
```

This approach ensures consistent log management across your entire application stack.

## Method 2: Safe Log File Truncation

When you need to immediately clear logs from running containers, truncation provides a safe method that preserves log file structure while freeing disk space.

### Single Container Truncation

Clear logs for a specific container:

```bash
# Get the container ID
docker ps

# Truncate the log file
truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/<container_id>/<container_id>-json.log
```

For easier identification, use the container name:

```bash
docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' container_name | xargs truncate -s 0
```

### Bulk Log Truncation

Clear logs for all containers simultaneously:

```bash
# Truncate all container logs
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log

# Alternative method using find
sudo find /var/lib/docker/containers -name "*-json.log" -exec truncate -s 0 {} \;
```

### Verification

Confirm successful truncation:

```bash
# Check log file sizes
du -sh /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log

# Verify logs are cleared
docker logs container_name
```

**Note**: Truncation may interrupt `docker logs -f` (follow) commands. Active log streaming requires restarting.

## Method 3: Complete Log File Deletion

For scenarios requiring complete log removal, deletion provides thorough cleanup but requires careful execution.

### Safe Deletion Process

1. **Stop the container** (recommended for safety):
```bash
docker stop container_name
```

2. **Delete the log file**:
```bash
rm /var/lib/docker/containers/<container_id>/<container_id>-json.log
```

3. **Restart Docker daemon** (to recreate log file structure):
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

4. **Start the container**:
```bash
docker start container_name
```

### Bulk Deletion Script

For multiple containers, create an automated script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# bulk_log_cleanup.sh

# Stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Remove all log files
sudo rm /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log

# Restart Docker
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Start containers
docker start $(docker ps -aq)

echo "Log cleanup completed successfully"
```

Make the script executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x bulk_log_cleanup.sh
./bulk_log_cleanup.sh
```

## Method 4: System-Level Log Rotation with Logrotate

For advanced log management, integrate Docker logs with the system's `logrotate` utility for scheduled automatic rotation.

### Create Logrotate Configuration

```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/docker-container-logs
```

Add the following configuration:

```bash
/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 7
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    copytruncate
    create 0640 root root
    maxsize 100M
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/docker kill -s USR1 $(docker ps -q) 2>/dev/null || true
    endscript
}
```

### Configuration Options Explained

- `daily`: Rotate logs daily
- `rotate 7`: Keep 7 days of rotated logs
- `compress`: Compress rotated logs to save space
- `delaycompress`: Wait one cycle before compressing
- `missingok`: Don't error if log files are missing
- `notifempty`: Don't rotate empty files
- `copytruncate`: Copy and truncate the original file
- `maxsize 100M`: Rotate if file exceeds 100MB regardless of schedule
- `postrotate`: Send USR1 signal to containers for log reopening

### Test Logrotate Configuration

```bash
# Test the configuration
sudo logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/docker-container-logs

# Force rotation for testing
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/docker-container-logs
```

## Method 5: Alternative Logging Drivers

Reduce local storage consumption by configuring Docker to send logs directly to external systems.

### Syslog Driver Configuration

Send logs to the system log service:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --log-driver=syslog \
  --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://localhost:514 \
  --log-opt tag="docker/{{.Name}}" \
  nginx:latest
```

### Journald Integration

Integrate with systemd's journal:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --log-driver=journald \
  --log-opt labels=service \
  nginx:latest

# View logs through journalctl
journalctl -u docker.service -f
```

### Remote Logging Solutions

Configure containers to send logs directly to remote systems:

```bash
# Fluentd driver
docker run -d \
  --log-driver=fluentd \
  --log-opt fluentd-address=localhost:24224 \
  --log-opt tag="docker.{{.Name}}" \
  application:latest

# AWS CloudWatch
docker run -d \
  --log-driver=awslogs \
  --log-opt awslogs-group=my-application \
  --log-opt awslogs-stream=container-logs \
  application:latest
```

## Emergency Disk Space Recovery

When your system is critically low on disk space and containers are failing, follow these emergency steps:

### 1. Immediate Space Recovery

```bash
# Quick truncation of all logs
sudo sh -c 'truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log'

# Verify space recovery
df -h
```

### 2. Identify Largest Log Files

```bash
# Find the largest log files
sudo find /var/lib/docker/containers -name "*-json.log" -exec du -h {} \; | sort -hr | head -10

# Detailed breakdown per container
sudo du -sh /var/lib/docker/containers/*/
```

### 3. Clean Docker System

```bash
# Remove unused containers, networks, images
docker system prune -a -f

# Remove dangling volumes
docker volume prune -f
```

## Automation and Monitoring

### Automated Cleanup Script

Create a comprehensive cleanup script for regular execution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# docker-log-cleanup.sh

LOG_DIR="/var/lib/docker/containers"
MAX_SIZE="100M"
BACKUP_DIR="/var/backups/docker-logs"

echo "Starting Docker log cleanup - $(date)"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Function to cleanup logs larger than MAX_SIZE
cleanup_large_logs() {
    find "$LOG_DIR" -name "*-json.log" -size +$MAX_SIZE -exec bash -c '
        container_id=$(basename $(dirname "$1"))
        container_name=$(docker inspect --format="{{.Name}}" "$container_id" 2>/dev/null | sed "s/^///")
        
        if [ -n "$container_name" ]; then
            echo "Cleaning logs for container: $container_name ($container_id)"
            
            # Create backup before cleanup
            cp "$1" "'"$BACKUP_DIR"'/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$container_name.log"
            
            # Truncate the log file
            truncate -s 0 "$1"
            
            echo "Cleaned: $1 ($(du -h "$1" | cut -f1))"
        fi
    ' bash {} \;
}

# Execute cleanup
cleanup_large_logs

# Clean old backups (older than 7 days)
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;

echo "Docker log cleanup completed - $(date)"
```

### Cron Job Setup

Schedule automated cleanup:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add daily cleanup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/docker-log-cleanup.sh >> /var/log/docker-cleanup.log 2>&1

# Add hourly checking for critical disk space
0 * * * * df -h | awk '$5 > 90 {print $0}' | grep -q . && /path/to/emergency-cleanup.sh
```

### Monitoring Script

Create a monitoring script to alert on log growth:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# docker-log-monitor.sh

ALERT_THRESHOLD="1G"
EMAIL="admin@example.com"

check_log_sizes() {
    find /var/lib/docker/containers -name "*-json.log" -size +$ALERT_THRESHOLD -exec bash -c '
        container_id=$(basename $(dirname "$1"))
        container_name=$(docker inspect --format="{{.Name}}" "$container_id" 2>/dev/null | sed "s/^///")
        size=$(du -h "$1" | cut -f1)
        
        echo "ALERT: Container $container_name has log file size: $size"
        
        # Optional: Send email alert
        # echo "Container $container_name log size exceeded threshold: $size" | mail -s "Docker Log Alert" $EMAIL
    ' bash {} \;
}

check_log_sizes
```

## Best Practices for Docker Log Management

### 1. Implement Structured Logging

Configure applications to output JSON-formatted logs for better parsing and analysis:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-24T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "message": "Authentication failed",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "error_code": "AUTH001"
}
```

### 2. Establish Log Retention Policies

Define clear policies based on your requirements:

- **Development**: 1-3 days retention
- **Staging**: 7-14 days retention
- **Production**: 30-90 days retention (based on compliance needs)

### 3. Monitor Disk Usage

Implement automated monitoring:

```bash
# Disk usage alert script
#!/bin/bash
THRESHOLD=80
USAGE=$(df /var/lib/docker | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')

if [ $USAGE -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Docker directory usage at ${USAGE}%"
    # Trigger cleanup or alert
fi
```

### 4. Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Configure log filters to exclude passwords, tokens, and PII
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to log directories using appropriate file permissions
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for remote logging to protect data in transit

### 5. Performance Optimization

- **Non-blocking Mode**: Use `mode=non-blocking` for high-throughput applications
- **Buffer Configuration**: Adjust `max-buffer-size` for remote logging drivers
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU and memory limits for logging infrastructure

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "No Space Left on Device" Errors

**Immediate Solution:**
```bash
# Quick space recovery
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log

# Clean Docker system
docker system prune -a -f
```

**Root Cause Prevention:**
- Implement log rotation configuration
- Set up disk usage monitoring
- Create automated cleanup scripts

### Container Restart Doesn't Clear Logs

**Problem**: Many expect `docker restart` to clear logs, but logs persist across container restarts.

**Solution**: Logs are only cleared when containers are removed and recreated:
```bash
# This DOES NOT clear logs
docker restart container_name

# This DOES clear logs
docker rm container_name
docker run [original_options] image_name
```

### Log Rotation Not Working

**Verification Steps:**
```bash
# Check Docker daemon configuration
cat /etc/docker/daemon.json

# Verify container logging configuration
docker inspect container_name | grep -A 10 "LogConfig"

# Test log rotation manually
docker run -d --log-opt max-size=1m --log-opt max-file=2 busybox sh -c 'while true; do echo "Test log entry $(date)"; sleep 1; done'
```

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Log Clearing Methods Comparison

| Method | Speed | Safety | Downtime | Use Case |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Truncation | Fast | High | None | Running containers |
| Deletion | Fast | Medium | Required | Maintenance windows |
| Rotation | Automated | High | None | Preventive measure |
| Driver Config | Automated | High | None | New deployments |

### Disk Space Recovery Results

Based on real-world implementations:

- **Log Rotation**: 60-80% storage reduction through compression
- **Truncation**: 100% immediate space recovery
- **Centralized Logging**: 95% local storage reduction
- **Automated Cleanup**: 70% average storage optimization
