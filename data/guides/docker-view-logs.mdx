Docker containers generate critical telemetry data through their logs, but accessing and analyzing this information efficiently can be challenging without the right approach. Whether you're debugging a failing deployment, monitoring application performance, or investigating security incidents, understanding Docker's logging capabilities is fundamental to maintaining healthy containerized systems.

This guide walks you through Docker container logging from basic commands to production-ready strategies, including integration with observability platforms for comprehensive log analysis.

## Understanding Docker's Logging Architecture

Docker captures all output from containerized applications that write to standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr). This follows the twelve-factor app principle where applications should treat logs as event streams written to the console rather than managing log files internally.

When containers generate output, Docker automatically captures this data using configurable logging drivers. The system stores logs with metadata including timestamps, stream origin (stdout/stderr), and message content. By default, Docker uses the `json-file` driver, storing logs as JSON-formatted files in `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/<container-id>-json.log`.

**Important**: While `json-file` remains the default for backward compatibility, Docker now recommends the `local` driver for production environments. The `local` driver provides better performance, built-in log rotation, and more efficient disk usage.

## Basic Docker Log Commands

Let's start with a practical example. Create a test container to follow along:

```bash
docker run -d --name test-nginx nginx:latest
```

To list all running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Viewing Container Logs

The most basic command retrieves all available logs:

```bash
docker logs test-nginx
```

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/07/docker-view-logs-view-all-container-logs.webp" alt="Docker Logs Command" caption="View all container logs" />

You can use either container names or IDs:

```bash
docker logs 1a2b3c4d5e6f
```

### Real-Time Log Streaming

For active monitoring, use the `--follow` flag to stream logs as they're generated:

```bash
docker logs --follow test-nginx
```

<Figure src="/img/guides/2025/07/docker-view-logs-live-logs.webp" alt="Docker Logs Command" caption="Real-time log streaming" />

This is essential for troubleshooting active issues or monitoring deployments. Press Ctrl+C to stop streaming.

### Limiting Log Output

Use `--tail` to view only recent entries:

```bash
docker logs --tail 50 test-nginx
```

Combine with `--follow` for continuous monitoring of recent activity:

```bash
docker logs --tail 20 --follow test-nginx
```

## Advanced Log Filtering and Analysis

Docker provides powerful filtering options for precise log analysis, particularly valuable in production environments with high log volumes.

### Time-Based Filtering

Filter logs for specific time windows to investigate incidents or analyze patterns:

```bash
docker logs --since "2025-01-20T10:00:00" --until "2025-01-20T12:00:00" test-nginx
```

Docker accepts ISO 8601 timestamps and relative time specifications:

```bash
docker logs --since "24h" test-nginx      # Last 24 hours
docker logs --since "2h30m" test-nginx    # Last 2 hours and 30 minutes
docker logs --since "15m" test-nginx      # Last 15 minutes
```

### Pattern Matching and Text Processing

Combine `docker logs` with Unix text processing tools for powerful analysis:

```bash
docker logs test-nginx | grep -i "error"                    # Case-insensitive error search
docker logs test-nginx | grep -E "(error|warning)"          # Multiple patterns
docker logs test-nginx | grep -B 5 -A 5 "timeout"          # Context around matches
```

Chain multiple filters for sophisticated analysis:

```bash
docker logs --since "1h" test-nginx | grep "POST" | wc -l   # Count POST requests in last hour
```

### Exporting Logs

Save logs for offline analysis or sharing:

```bash
docker logs test-nginx > nginx_logs.txt                     # Save all logs
docker logs --since "24h" test-nginx > recent_logs.txt     # Save recent logs
docker logs test-nginx 2>&1 | tee analysis.log            # Save while viewing
```

The `2>&1` redirection captures both stdout and stderr, while `tee` displays logs on screen while saving to file.

### Multi-Container Analysis

For complex applications, analyze logs across multiple containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose logs                          # All services
docker-compose logs web database             # Specific services
docker-compose logs --tail=100 --follow     # Real-time monitoring
```

## Troubleshooting Common Logging Issues

### Empty or Missing Logs

**Application writes to files instead of console**: Many applications log to files inside containers rather than stdout/stderr. Docker only captures console output.

**Solution**: Configure applications to log to stdout/stderr, or use symbolic links:

```dockerfile
# Inside Dockerfile
RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log
RUN ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

**Output buffering**: Programming languages often buffer output, preventing immediate log visibility.

**Solution**: Disable buffering through environment variables:

```bash
docker run -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 my-python-app
```

**Incorrect logging driver**: Some drivers don't support `docker logs` command.

**Solution**: Check the logging driver and enable dual logging if needed:

```bash
docker inspect container_name --format='{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}'
```

### Log Rotation Issues

**Insufficient retention**: Default settings may rotate logs too aggressively.

**Solution**: Adjust rotation parameters in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "50m",
    "max-file": "10"
  }
}
```

**No rotation**: Some configurations lack proper rotation, leading to disk exhaustion.

**Solution**: Always configure appropriate log rotation and monitor disk usage.

### Permission Problems

Use `sudo` when necessary or add your user to the docker group (consider security implications):

```bash
sudo docker logs container_name
```

## Docker Logging Configuration

### Logging Driver Options

**json-file (Default)**: Stores logs as JSON files. Simple but lacks advanced features.

**local (Recommended)**: Optimized file-based driver with better performance, compression, and efficient storage.

**syslog**: Integrates with system logging services for centralized management.

**journald**: Forwards logs to systemd journal on supported systems.

**fluentd**: Routes logs to Fluentd collectors for flexible processing.

**awslogs**: Directly sends logs to AWS CloudWatch.

### Global Configuration

Configure default logging behavior in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "25m",
    "max-file": "5",
    "compress": "true"
  }
}
```

Restart Docker after configuration changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Per-Container Configuration

Override defaults for specific containers:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --log-driver local \
  --log-opt max-size=10m \
  --log-opt max-file=3 \
  --name custom-logs \
  nginx:latest
```

For Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    logging:
      driver: local
      options:
        max-size: "15m"
        max-file: "7"
        compress: "true"
```

## Production Best Practices

### Storage Management

Monitor Docker log directories and implement alerting:

```bash
# Monitor log directory usage
du -sh /var/lib/docker/containers/

# Automated cleanup (use carefully)
find /var/lib/docker/containers/ -name "*-json.log*" -mtime +30 -delete
```

Configure appropriate rotation balancing retention needs with storage:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "25m",
    "max-file": "5"
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Ensure applications don't log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII)
- Restrict access to log directories and consider encryption
- Implement clear log retention policies for compliance

### Performance Optimization

- Choose appropriate logging drivers based on requirements
- Configure applications with suitable log levels for production
- Use asynchronous logging frameworks to prevent bottlenecks

### Centralized Logging Strategy

**Standardize log formats**: Use structured logging (JSON) for better machine readability:

```javascript
// Example structured logging
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: 'info',
  service: 'web-api',
  message: 'User authentication successful',
  userId: 'user123',
  requestId: 'req-456'
}));
```

**Implement correlation**: Use correlation IDs to connect related log entries across containers.
