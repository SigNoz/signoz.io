SSH (Secure Shell) logs are crucial for monitoring and maintaining the security and performance of systems that use SSH for remote management. SSH logs are typically recorded by the SSH daemon (`sshd`), which is responsible for handling incoming SSH connections. These logs can provide insights into user activity, connection attempts, authentication successes and failures, and other relevant events. Monitoring these logs is essential for detecting unauthorized access attempts, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring compliance with security policies.

Here's an example of a typical SSH log entry:

```bash
Jul 17 09:23:45 server1 sshd[1234]: Accepted publickey for user1 from 192.168.1.100 port 52413 ssh2: RSA SHA256:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789ABCDEFG
```

This log entry contains valuable information such as the timestamp, server name, process ID, authentication method, username, source IP address, port number, and the type of encryption key used. By analyzing these logs, system administrators can track user access, identify potential security threats, and maintain a secure SSH environment.

### Key Elements of SSH Logs

SSH logs contain various types of information, each serving a different purpose in understanding and managing SSH activity. The key elements typically found in SSH logs include:

1. Timestamp:
    - Indicates the date and time when the log entry was recorded.
    - Example: `Jul 12 08:23:45`
2. Hostname:
    - The name of the host machine where the SSH daemon is running.
    - Example: `server1`
3. Process Name:
    - The name of the process that generated the log entry, usually `sshd`.
    - Example: `sshd`
4. Process ID (PID):
    - The process ID of the SSH daemon instance that generated the log entry.
    - Example: `1234`
5. Event Type:
    - Describes the type of event being logged, such as an authentication attempt, session start, or session end.
    - Common event types include `Accepted`, `Failed`, `Disconnected`, `session opened`, and `session closed`.

We will later see a breakdown of these elements in actual SSH logs examples.

## Accessing SSH Logs

SSH logs are essential for monitoring the security and activity of SSH connections on your system. They can be accessed using various methods, depending on your system's logging setup and distribution. Below are some common ways to access SSH logs on Linux systems.

### Using `journalctl`

`journalctl` is a command used to view logs managed by `systemd`, which is the system and service manager used in many modern Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian.

On systems that use `systemd`, such as modern versions of Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian, SSH logs are managed by the `journald` service. The `journalctl` command is used to access these logs.

To view SSH logs specifically, you can use:

```
journalctl -u ssh
```

This command filters the logs to show entries related to the SSH service. You can further refine your search by adding time ranges or other filters. For example:

```
journalctl -u ssh --since "2023-07-01" --until "2023-07-12"
```

### Accessing `/var/log/auth.log`

On some systems, especially older ones or those that do not use `systemd`, SSH logs are recorded in the `/var/log/auth.log` file. This is common in older versions of Debian, Ubuntu, and other distributions that use SysVinit or other init systems.

To view the SSH logs in `/var/log/auth.log`, you can use common text file viewing commands such as `cat`, `less`, or `tail`.

For example:

```java
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

Or to search for specific SSH-related entries:

```java
grep sshd /var/log/auth.log
```

### Other common commands for viewing logs

Apart from `journalctl` and direct access to `/var/log/auth.log`, there are other commands and tools you can use to view and manage SSH logs:

1. `cat`:
    
    ```
    cat /var/log/auth.log
    ```
    
2. `less`:
    
    ```
    less /var/log/auth.log
    ```
    
3. `grep`:
    
    ```
    grep sshd /var/log/auth.log
    ```
    
4. `tail`:
    
    ```
    tail -f /var/log/auth.log
    ```
    
5. `rsyslog` or `syslog-ng`:
    - These are logging daemons that may be configured to direct SSH logs to specific files or remote logging servers.
- SSH Logs on Ubuntu: Modern versions use `journalctl`, but older versions use `/var/log/auth.log`.
- SSH Logs on CentOS: Similar to Ubuntu, modern CentOS uses `journalctl`, while older versions might use `/var/log/secure`.
- SSH Logs on Debian: Follows the same pattern as Ubuntu, using `journalctl` in modern versions and `/var/log/auth.log` in older versions.
- SSH Logs on Linux: Generally, modern Linux distributions with `systemd` use `journalctl`. Older distributions or those using other init systems use specific log files like `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`.
- SSH Logs on Windows: Windows does not natively support SSH in the same way as Linux. However, with OpenSSH installed on Windows, logs can be accessed through Event Viewer or specific log files in the OpenSSH installation directory.

## Interpreting SSH Logs

SSH logs contain detailed information about SSH connections to your server. Understanding these logs is crucial for monitoring access and maintaining security. Let's break down the key types of log entries you might encounter.

### Log Entries

SSH logs typically include information such as timestamps, user information, IP addresses, and the outcome of login attempts. These logs can be found using `journalctl` on modern systems or in `/var/log/auth.log` on older systems.

### Successful Login and Failed Login Attempts

A successful login attempt log entry indicates that a user has successfully authenticated and gained access to the server.

Example:

```java
Jul 12 08:23:45 server1 sshd[1234]: Accepted password for user1 from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2
```

Breakdown:

- Timestamp: `Jul 12 08:23:45` – The date and time of the login attempt.
- Hostname: `server1` – The name of the server where the login occurred.
- Process Name and ID: `sshd[1234]` – The SSH daemon process and its ID.
- Event Type: `Accepted password` – Indicates a successful password authentication.
- User: `user1` – The username of the person who logged in.
- Remote Host: `192.168.1.100` – The IP address of the remote client.
- Port: `22` – The port number used for the SSH connection.
- Protocol: `ssh2` – The SSH protocol version used.

A failed login attempt log entry indicates that a user tried to log in but failed to authenticate. This can happen for various reasons, such as incorrect passwords or attempts to log in with invalid usernames.

Example:

```java
Jul 12 08:24:10 server1 sshd[1234]: Failed password for invalid user fakeuser from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2
```

Breakdown:

- Timestamp: `Jul 12 08:24:10` – The date and time of the login attempt.
- Hostname: `server1` – The name of the server where the login attempt occurred.
- Process Name and ID: `sshd[1234]` – The SSH daemon process and its ID.
- Event Type: `Failed password` – Indicates a failed password authentication attempt.
- User: `invalid user fakeuser` – Shows that an invalid username was used.
- Remote Host: `192.168.1.100` – The IP address of the remote client.
- Port: `22` – The port number used for the SSH connection.
- Protocol: `ssh2` – The SSH protocol version used.

## Log Management

Effective log management is crucial for maintaining the security and performance of your SSH-enabled systems. Here's a guide on securing SSH access, setting log levels, filtering logs, real-time monitoring, and using `lastlog`.

### Securing SSH Access

1. Restrict SSH Access:
    - Allow Specific Users:
    Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to allow only specific users to log in via SSH:
        
        ```
        AllowUsers user1 user2
        ```
        
    - Disable Root Login:
    It’s a good security practice to disable root login via SSH:
        
        ```
        PermitRootLogin no
        ```
        
2. Use Key-Based Authentication:
    - Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine:
        
        ```
        ssh-keygen
        ```
        
    - Copy the public key to the remote server:
        
        ```
        ssh-copy-id user@remote_server
        ```
        
    - Disable password authentication in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:
        
        ```
        PasswordAuthentication no
        ```
        
3. Change the Default SSH Port:
    - Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to use a non-standard port:
        
        ```
        Port 2222
        ```
        
    - Restart the SSH service:
        
        ```
        sudo systemctl restart ssh
        ```
        

### Setting Log Levels for SSHD

Adjusting the log level in SSH can help you capture more detailed information or reduce log verbosity.

1. Edit the SSH Configuration File:
    - Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in a text editor:
        
        ```
        sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        ```
        
    - Find and modify the `LogLevel` directive. Available options include `QUIET`, `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `INFO`, `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`, `DEBUG1`, `DEBUG2`, and `DEBUG3`:
        
        ```
        LogLevel INFO
        ```
        
    - Save the changes and restart SSH:
        
        ```
        sudo systemctl restart ssh
        ```
        

### Filtering Logs

Use `journalctl` to filter logs by different parameters.

1. By Date/Time:
    - To view logs since a specific date:
        
        ```
        journalctl -u ssh --since "2023-07-01"
        ```
        
    - To view logs within a date range:
        
        ```
        journalctl -u ssh --since "2023-07-01" --until "2023-07-12"
        ```
        
2. By Priority:
    - To view logs of a specific priority (e.g., errors):
        
        ```
        journalctl -u ssh -p err
        ```
        

### Real-time Log Monitoring

To monitor SSH logs in real-time, you can use `journalctl` or `tail`.

1. Using `journalctl`:
    
    ```
    journalctl -u ssh -f
    ```
    
2. Using `tail` (for older systems that log to `/var/log/auth.log`):
    
    ```
    tail -f /var/log/auth.log
    ```
    

### Using `lastlog`

`lastlog` is a command-line utility that displays the most recent login of all users or a specific user on the system.

1. View All Users' Last Login:
    
    ```
    lastlog
    ```
    
2. View a Specific User's Last Login:
    
    ```
    lastlog -u username
    ```
    

## Send Logs to SigNoz
