Logging is crucial for detecting bugs early, tracing issues efficiently, and mitigating hacking attempts. To achieve these benefits, it's essential to set up logging correctly.

This article will teach us how to use Golang to generate logs effectively, including setting up loggers, formatting log messages, and managing log levels. By mastering these techniques, you can ensure robust and reliable logging in your applications.

## Basics of Logging in GoLang

Logging is the practice of recording or storing information and messages that provide insights into the behavior and execution of a program.

Logging and monitoring are crucial for several reasons, including:

- Faster Problem Detection: Issues within the system are identified more rapidly.
- Quicker Issue Resolution: Reduced time to repair problems, leading to less downtime.
- Greater System Transparency: Clear visibility into system operations and performance.
- Enhanced User Experience: Improved reliability and satisfaction for customers.
- Stronger Security Measures: Better detection and response to security threats.

## Prerequisites

- Go Installation: Ensure that Go is installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official <a href="https://golang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Go website</a>.
- Text Editor or IDE: Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Go code. A popular choice is Visual Studio Code, if you do not have it, you can download it <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Standard Library Logging

In Golang, the standard package provided for logging is the `log` package. The `log` package offers a simple and easy-to-use interface for logging messages, errors, and other information.

The `log` package also provides a default logger that writes to the standard error and includes methods for formatting output.

### Creating Simple Log Entries

The `log` package offers several methods to log messages:

- `log.Print()`: logs a message without a new line.
- `log.Println()`: logs a message with a new line.
- `log.Printf()`: logs a formatted message.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
)

func main() {
    log.Print("This is a common log message. ")
    log.Println("This is a log message with a new line.")
    log.Printf("This is a formatted log message: %s", "Signoz")
}
```

Output:

```
This is a common log message. This is a log message with a new line.
This is a formatted log message: Signoz
```

### Customizing the `log` Package

Setting Log Flags

You can configure the output of log messages using flags to include date, time, and file information.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
)

func main() {
    log.SetFlags(log.Ldate | log.Ltime | log.Lshortfile)
    log.Println("This log message includes date, time, and file information.")
}

```

Output:

```
2024/06/27 12:34:56 main.go:9: This log message includes date, time, and file information.
```

Redirecting Log Output

You can set a custom output destination, such as a file.

Logging to Files:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.OpenFile("app.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_APPEND, 0666)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    log.SetOutput(file)
    log.Println("This log message will be written to the file.")
}
```

Output(`app.log` )

```
2024/06/27 12:34:56 main.go:12: This log message will be written to the file.
```

Handling Log Prefixes

The `log` package does not have built-in support for different logging levels like Info, Warning, and Error. However, you can create custom loggers to simulate different logging levels.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
    warningLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "WARNING: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
    // When logging error messages it is good practice to use 'os.Stderr' instead of os.Stdout
    errorLog := log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)

    infoLog.Println("This is an info message.")
    warningLog.Println("This is a warning message.")
    errorLog.Println("This is an error message.")
}

```

Output:

```
INFO: 2024/06/27 12:34:56 main.go:12: This is an info message.
WARNING: 2024/06/27 12:34:56 main.go:13: This is a warning message.
ERROR: 2024/06/27 12:34:56 main.go:14: This is an error message.
```

## Third-Party Logging Libraries

In addition to the standard `log` package provided by Go, several popular third-party logging libraries offerres and flexibility.

These libraries cater to various logging requirements, including:

- Structured logging
- Customizable logging levels
- Efficient log rotation
- Seamless integration with external systems

Let's discuss some popular logging libraries in GoLang:

### logrus

`logrus` is a structured logging library for Go (Golang) that offers extensive features and flexibility. It is widely used for its ability to handle structured log data efficiently and its customizable logging levels.

Installation and Setup

To use `logrus` in your Go application, you need to install it using `go get` on your Terminal /PowerShell:

```bash
go get github.com/sirupsen/logrus
```

After installation, import `logrus` into your Go code (if there is an error run `go mod tidy`):

```go
import (
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)
```

Basic Usage and Features

- Structured Logging: Using `logrus` developers can log key-value pairs or structured data along with regular log messages.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new logger instance
    logger := logrus.New()

    // Example of structured logging
    logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
        "animal": "whale",
        "size":   5,
    }).Info("A school of whales emerge from the ocean")
}

```

Output:

```
INFO[0000] A group of whales emerges from the ocean      animal=whale size=5
```

- Logging Levels: `logrus` provides different logging levels (Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal, Panic), allowing developers to control the verbosity of log messages based on their severity.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    logger := logrus.New()

    // Set log level to debug to ensure debug messages are logged
    logger.SetLevel(logrus.DebugLevel)

    logger.Debug("This is a debug message")
    logger.Info("This is an informational message")
    logger.Warn("This is a warning message")
    logger.Error("This is an error message")
}

```

Output:

```
DEBU[0000] This is a debug message
INFO[0000] This is an informational message
WARNING[0000] This is a warning message
ERROR[0000] This is an error message
```

- Hooks and Formatters: `logrus` supports hooks and formatters, enabling developers to customize how logs are processed and formatted. Hooks allow actions to be taken when logging events occur, while formatters control the output format of log messages.

```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new logger instance
    logger := logrus.New()

    // Example of setting a custom formatter
    logger.SetFormatter(&logrus.JSONFormatter{})

    // Logging with the modified logger
    logger.Info("This is a JSON formatted log message")
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "This is a JSON formatted log message",
  "time": "2024-06-27T12:00:00Z"
}
```

    }

    // Build the logger with the custom configuration
    logger, _ := config.Build()
    defer logger.Sync() // Flushes buffer, if any

    // Log a message with the custom logger
    logger.Info("This is a log message with custom configuration")
}

```

Output:

```json
{"level":"info","ts":"2024-06-27T12:00:00Z","caller":"main/main.go:29","msg":"This is a log message with custom configuration"
```

### Zerolog

    log.Logger = log.Output(zerolog.ConsoleWriter{Out: os.Stderr})

    // Example of pretty logging
    log.Info().Str("foo", "bar").Msg("Pretty logging example")
}
```

Output:

```
8:28PM INF Pretty logging example foo=bar
```

### Glog

`glog` is a library for Go that implements logging with severity levels. Developed by Google, Glog offers simple usage patterns and is designed to handle log file rotation automatically. It is an excellent choice for applications that require categorized logging.

Installation and Setup

To use Glog in your Go application, you need to install it using `go get`:

```
go get github.com/golang/glog
```

After installation, you can import `glog` into your Go code:

```go
import (
    "flag"
    "github.com/golang/glog"
)
```

Basic Usage and Features

- Log Severity Levels: `glog` supports different log severity levels: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL. Each level can be used to categorize log messages according to their importance and urgency.

```go
package main

import (
    "flag"
    "github.com/golang/glog"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the command line flags.
    flag.Parse()

    // Set the default log level to INFO.
    flag.Lookup("stderrthreshold").Value.Set("INFO")

    // Log messages with different severity levels.
    glog.Info("This is an info message")
    glog.Warning("This is a warning message")
    glog.Error("This is an error message")

    // Flushes all pending log I/O.
    glog.Flush()
}
```

Output:

```
I0628 20:51:18.894766   12527 main.go:16] This is an info message
W0628 20:51:18.895714   12527 main.go:17] This is a warning message
E0628 20:51:18.896319   12527 main.go:18] This is an error message
```

- Log File Rotation: `glog` handles log file rotation automatically, creating log files in the current working directory by default. Log files rotate based on size and time.

To demonstrate log file rotation, use the following example and run it with the `-log_dir` flag to specify the log directory.

```go
package main

import (
    "flag"
    "github.com/golang/glog"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize the command line flags.
    flag.Parse()
        // Set the default log level to INFO
    flag.Lookup("stderrthreshold").Value.Set("INFO")

    // Log messages to demonstrate file rotation.
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        glog.Infof("Log message number %d", i)
    }
}
```

Run the program with:

```
go run main.go -log_dir=./logs
```

Output:

```
I0628 20:58:23.456944   13419 main.go:16] Log message number 0
I0628 20:58:23.457619   13419 main.go:16] Log message number 1
I0628 20:58:23.457630   13419 main.go:16] Log message number 2
I0628 20:58:23.457634   13419 main.go:16] Log message number 3
I0628 20:58:23.457638   13419 main.go:16] Log message number 4
```

### Log15

Package `log15` provides an easy-to-use logging toolkit inspired by the `io` and `net/http` packages. It enforces logging with key/value pairs, using strings for keys and any type for values. The default format is `logfmt`, with optional JSON support for output.

Installation and Setup

To use Log15 in your Go application, you need to install it using `go get`:

```
go get github.com/inconshreveable/log15
```

After installation, you can import `log15` into your Go code:

```go
import (
    "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"
)
```

Basic Usage and Features

- Structured Logging with Key-Value Pairs: `log15` excels in structured logging using key-value pairs, making log entries more informative and easier to search and analyze.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new logger
    logger := log15.New()

    // Log a structured message with key-value pairs
    logger.Info("User signup", "username", "akhigbeeromo", "email", "akhigbeeromo@signoz.com")
}

```

Output:

```
INFO[06-29|02:36:13] User signup                              username=akhigbeeromo email=akhigbeeromo@signoz.com
```

- Handlers for Different Outputs: `log15` supports handlers, allowing logs to be directed to different outputs such as the console, files, or remote systems.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new logger
    logger := log15.New()

    // Create a file handler
    file, err := os.Create("app.log")
    if err != nil {
        log15.Crit("Failed to create log file", "err", err)
        return
    }
    fileHandler := log15.StreamHandler(file, log15.LogfmtFormat())

    // Set the logger to use both console and file handlers
    logger.SetHandler(log15.MultiHandler(
        log15.StderrHandler, // Log to stderr
        fileHandler,         // Log to the file
    ))

    // Log a message
    logger.Info("Application started", "version", "1.0.0")
}
```

Output(Console and `app.log` file):

```
INFO[06-27|15:00:00.123] Application started version=1.0.0
```

- Configurable Log Levels: `log15` allows configuring log levels to filter log messages according to their severity.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/inconshreveable/log15"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new logger
    logger := log15.New()

    // Set the log level to INFO
    logger.SetHandler(log15.LvlFilterHandler(log15.LvlInfo, log15.StdoutHandler))

    // Log messages with different levels
    logger.Debug("This is a debug message") // This will not be logged
    logger.Info("This is an info message")
    logger.Warn("This is a warning message")
    logger.Error("This is an error message")
}

```

Output:

```

        <rollingfile type="size" filename="logs/app.log" maxsize="1000000" maxrolls="5"/>
    </outputs>
    <formats>
        <format id="main" format="%Date %Time [%LEVEL] %Msg%n"/>
    </formats>
</seelog>
```

- Custom Log Formats: Enables highly customizable log messages, including timestamps, log levels, and additional context such as function names and line numbers.

```xml
<seelog minlevel="info">
    <outputs formatid="detailed">
        <console/>
    </outputs>
    <formats>
        <format id="detailed" format="%Date %Time [%LEVEL] [%FuncShort @ %File:%Line] %Msg%n"/>
    </formats>
</seelog>
```

Loading this configuration in your Go application will produce detailed log messages that include function names and line numbers:

## Guidelines for Effective Logging in GoLang

1. Categorize Logs According to Their Respective Levels

   Log levels categorize messages based on their importance and severity, aiding in effective troubleshooting and monitoring. Log levels include:

   - DEBUG: provides detailed information useful for diagnosing problems.
   - INFO: highlights the progress or status of the application.
   - WARN: Indicates potential issues or situations that may lead to problems in the future.
   - ERROR: logs errors that are recoverable and allow the application to continue running.
   - FATAL: logs critical errors that cause the application to terminate.

2. Structured Logging: Use structured formats like JSON for logs to enhance searchability and parsing.
3. Consistent Log Formatting: Maintain uniform log formats across applications for clarity and automated processing.
4. Log Rotation and Retention: Implement log rotation to efficiently manage log file sizes, prevent disk space overload, and establish retention policies specifying the duration logs are stored before archiving or deletion.
5. Sensitive Data Handling: Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers to mitigate security risks and if necessary, ensure it is masked or obfuscated.
6. Correlation IDs: Utilize unique identifiers (correlation IDs) in logs to trace and link events across different components or services.
7. Centralized Logging: Aggregate logs from various sources into a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) for easier management and analysis.
8. Log Enrichment: Enrich logs with additional context such as user details, transaction IDs, or session information to facilitate troubleshooting and analysis.

## Monitoring Logs with an Observability Tool

Create a new file named `main.go` and paste the following code block into it:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	logFile, err := os.OpenFile("application.log", os.O_APPEND|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer logFile.Close()

	log.SetOutput(logFile)
	log.SetFlags(log.Ldate | log.Ltime | log.Lshortfile)

	http.HandleFunc("/", handleIndex)
	http.HandleFunc("/log", handleLog)
	http.HandleFunc("/data", handleData)
	http.HandleFunc("/error", handleError)

	fmt.Println("Server starting on http://localhost:8080")
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server failed to start: %v", err)
	}
}

func handleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	log.Printf("INFO: Accessing index page | method=%s\n", r.Method)
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "Welcome to the Go Application!")
}

func handleLog(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	switch r.Method {
	case "GET":
		log.Printf("INFO: Handled GET request on /log | method=%s | path=%s\n", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "Received a GET request at /log.")
	case "POST":
		log.Printf("INFO: Handled POST request on /log | method=%s | path=%s\n", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
		fmt.Fprintln(w, "Received a POST request at /log.")
	default:
		http.Error(w, "Unsupported HTTP method", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)
	}
}

func handleData(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	log.Printf("INFO: Data endpoint hit | method=%s | endpoint=/data\n", r.Method)
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "This is the data endpoint. Method used:", r.Method)
}

func handleError(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	log.Printf("ERROR: Error endpoint accessed | method=%s | endpoint=/error\n", r.Method)
	http.Error(w, "You have reached the error endpoint", http.StatusInternalServerError)
}

```

This Go code sets up a basic HTTP server that logs events to a file (`application.log`) using the standard `log` package. It demonstrates how to configure logging output and format, define HTTP request handlers, start an HTTP server, and handle errors. Each HTTP handler logs relevant information about incoming requests and responds with appropriate messages or errors to clients. This setup is useful for monitoring and debugging web applications in a structured manner.

After running your application you should see the following output on `localhost:8080/`:
