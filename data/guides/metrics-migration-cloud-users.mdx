title: "Cloud Metrics Migration Notice"
---

# 📌 Overview

We’re transitioning our metric naming from underscore-based (e.g., `system_memory_usage`) to dot-based conventions (e.g., `system.memory.usage`) across our cloud observability pipeline. This change aligns with OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, enables more intuitive PromQL and other queries, and ensures consistent naming across platforms (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, ClickHouse).

To facilitate a seamless migration, we’ve initiated a dual export phase where both the existing ClickHouse metrics exporter and the new `signozclickhousemetrics` exporter run concurrently. During this phase, underscore-based metrics remain in the background—hidden from user views—so you will only see dot-based metrics (`system.memory.usage`).

## 🔍 Why We Are Migrating

- **Semantic Alignment:** Dot-separated metric names follow the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions, providing clearer structure and hierarchy (e.g., `system.memory.usage`).
- **Improved Query Efficiency:** Modern PromQL and other query engines now support dots in metric names, enabling more intuitive and powerful queries.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Consistent naming across platforms (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, ClickHouse) reduces confusion and simplifies integrations.

## 📆 Migration Timeline

### Dual Export Phase (In Progress)

- **Start:** Already underway
- **Duration:** Until next week
- **Behavior:** Both the existing ClickHouse metrics exporter and the new `signozclickhousemetrics` exporter are running concurrently, you wont be able to see any change during this period.

### Final Migration (Next Week)

- We will retire the underscore-based exporter entirely.
- Only the `signozclickhousemetrics` exporter will remain active.
- You will continue to see **only** dot-based metric names moving forward.

## 📣 Final Rollout

From next week onwards, we will roll out the final migration. You will begin to see dot-based metric names exclusively; underscore-based metrics will no longer appear in your views.

## ✅ What You Need to Do

Absolutely **nothing**. The migration is fully managed by our team — your dashboards, alerts, and queries will continue to operate without any changes.
