Struggling with Python logging? You're not alone. Common headaches include:

- Logs that are too verbose or too sparse
- Missing critical info when debugging
- Performance hits from excessive logging
- Security risks from logging sensitive data

Let's fix that. Here are the best practices we'll cover:

- Use appropriate log levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical
- Create custom loggers: Tailor logging to your app's needs
- Format logs effectively: Make them readable and useful
- Centralize logging config: Maintain consistency across your app
- Rotate logs: Prevent massive log files
- Handle exceptions gracefully: Log errors without crashing
- Implement async logging: Boost performance
- Structure your logs: Make them easily searchable

Let’s dive deep into these best practices of logging in Python! (With Practical Examples)

## Loggers are Singletons

In Python logging practices, loggers operate as singletons, ensuring that `logging.getLogger(name)` consistently returns the same logger instance throughout the application. This design promotes uniformity in logging configurations, preventing conflicts and optimizing resource usage. By maintaining a single logger instance per name, developers benefit from streamlined logging operations and enhanced code readability, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot logging behaviours across complex applications.

Let's explore examples to see how multiple instances of non-singleton loggers with the same name can lead to conflicting configurations and inconsistent logging behavior. We'll then demonstrate how singleton loggers ensure uniformity in logging settings and prevent such conflicts, thereby maintaining clarity and reliability in log output across the application.

### Example: Non-Singleton Loggers (Hypothetical)

If loggers were not singletons, you might end up with different logger instances with the same name, each with its own configuration. This could lead to conflicts and unexpected logging behavior.

Hypothetical Non-Singleton Logger Example:

```python
import logging

# Setup first logger instance
logger1 = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')
logger1.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
console_handler1 = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter1 = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler1.setFormatter(formatter1)
logger1.addHandler(console_handler1)

# Setup second logger instance with the same name but different configuration
logger2 = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')
logger2.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
console_handler2 = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter2 = logging.Formatter('%(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler2.setFormatter(formatter2)
logger2.addHandler(console_handler2)

# Logging messages
logger1.debug("Debug message from logger1")
logger2.error("Error message from logger2")

```

In this hypothetical scenario, if `logger1` and `logger2` were not singletons, you would get inconsistent output depending on which logger instance handled the log message. The two instances might have different log levels and formats, leading to confusion and difficulty in managing log output.

### Example: Singleton Loggers (Real Scenario)

In reality, Python loggers are singletons. Let's demonstrate how this design helps maintain consistency and avoid conflicts.

Singleton Logger Example:

```python
import logging

# Setup logger instance
logger = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# Retrieve the same logger instance elsewhere in the application
same_logger = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')

# Confirm they are the same instance
print(logger is same_logger)  # Output: True

# Setup another handler to demonstrate consistency
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('example.log')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
same_logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Logging messages
logger.debug("Debug message from logger")
same_logger.error("Error message from same_logger")

```

### Explanation:

1. Singleton Logger Setup:
   - `logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')` is called twice, but both `logger` and `same_logger` refer to the same logger instance due to the singleton nature.
2. Configuration Consistency:
   - Both `logger` and `same_logger` share the same configuration. Adding handlers or changing log levels on one affects the other.
3. Log Messages:
   - The log messages will be handled by the same set of handlers, ensuring consistent log output. Both messages will appear in the console and the `example.log` file with the same format.

### Output:

```
2024-07-12 12:00:00,000 - exampleLogger - DEBUG - Debug message from logger
2024-07-12 12:00:00,000 - exampleLogger - ERROR - Error message from same_logger
True

```

And in `example.log`:

```
2024-07-12 12:00:00,000 - exampleLogger - DEBUG - Debug message from logger
2024-07-12 12:00:00,000 - exampleLogger - ERROR - Error message from same_logger

```

## Use Appropriate Log Levels

The use of appropriate log levels is the key best practice in python logging. It helps in categorizing log messages based on their importance and severity. The various log levels are as follows:

1. DEBUG: Used for granular details regarding program execution giving detailed information typically of interest when diagnosing problems.
2. INFO: Confirms the proper working of the program. Provides general operational messages that highlight the application's progress.
3. WARNING: Indicates any unexpected happenings or problems that one may encounter in the future
4. ERROR: Reports a serious issue, e.g. the software is unable to perform some function.
5. CRITICAL: Indicates a serious error reporting that the program can't work any longer.

Example:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

In this example:

- logging.basicConfig is used for configuring the logging system. The level parameter sets the threshold for the logger to DEBUG, which means that all messages with the set level or higher will be logged.
- logging.getLogger(name) is used to create a logger object with the same name as that of the current module.
- Various log messages are logged using different log levels(debug, info, warning, error, and critical).

On running the above program the output will be:

```
2024-07-08 00:16:01,199 - DEBUG - This is a debug message.
2024-07-08 00:16:01,199 - INFO - This is an info message.
2024-07-08 00:16:01,199 - WARNING - This is a warning message.
2024-07-08 00:16:01,199 - ERROR - This is an error message.
2024-07-08 00:16:01,199 - CRITICAL - This is a critical message.
```

## Create a Custom Logger

Custom loggers let you tailor the logging behaviour to fit specific needs. It lets you define custom formats, handlers, and even log-level thresholds for various application parts.

Let us now see an example of combining the configuration and usage of the custom logger:

```python
import logging
import logging.config

# Custom logger configuration
custom_logger_config = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {
        "customFormatter": {
            "format": "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
        }
    },
    "handlers": {
        "consoleHandler": {
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "customFormatter",
            "level": "DEBUG"
        },
        "fileHandler": {
            "class": "logging.FileHandler",
            "formatter": "customFormatter",
            "level": "INFO",
            "filename": "app.log",
            "mode": "w"
        }
    },
    "loggers": {
        "customLogger": {
            "handlers": ["consoleHandler", "fileHandler"],
            "level": "DEBUG",
            "propagate": False
        }
    }
}

# Apply the custom logger configuration
logging.config.dictConfig(custom_logger_config)

# Create the custom logger
logger = logging.getLogger("customLogger")

# Example log messages
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

Explanation:

- Configuration Dictionary: Used for defining the formatters, handlers, and loggers. Each handler uses a formatter, and each logger uses one or more handlers.
- Custom Formatter: Defines the format of log messages, like the timestamp, logger name, log level, and message.
- Handlers: The `consoleHandler` give log output to the console, while the `fileHandler` writes logs to a file (`app.log`).
- Custom Logger: The `customLogger` uses the defined handlers and has a log level of DEBUG, meaning it will log messages at this level and higher.

## Format Log messages

You can format log messages in Python using formatters. Formatters define the structure and content of the log output. They include details like timestamps, log levels, logger names, and the log message. It provides consistent and informative log entries which is important for debugging and monitoring.

In Python's `logging` module, you can create a formatter by defining a format string and passing it to the `logging.Formatter` class. The format string has various placeholders which can be replaced with corresponding log record attributes. Common placeholders are as follows:

- `%(asctime)s`: Provides the time of the creation of the log message.
- `%(name)s`: Provides logger name
- `%(levelname)s`: Gives log level
- `%(message)s`: Provides the actual log message
- `%(filename)s`: Filename where the log message originated
- `%(lineno)d`: The line number in the source file where the log message was created.

Let us now see the creation and use of formatters in Python logging:

```python
import logging

# Define the formatter
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Create handlers
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('formatted_app.log')

# Set the formatter for the handlers
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger('formattedLogger')

# Set the log level for the logger
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Add handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(console_handler)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Example log messages
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

The output for the above script will be:

```
2024-07-08 00:17:35,879 - formattedLogger - DEBUG - This is a debug message.
2024-07-08 00:17:35,879 - formattedLogger - INFO - This is an info message.
2024-07-08 00:17:35,879 - formattedLogger - WARNING - This is a warning message.
2024-07-08 00:17:35,879 - formattedLogger - ERROR - This is an error message.
2024-07-08 00:17:35,879 - formattedLogger - CRITICAL - This is a critical message.
```

## Centralize your logging configuration

In order to simplify, manage and maintain logging settings across your application, you should centralize your logging [information. It](http://information.it/) helps to easily adjust the logging configuration, like log levels, formats, and handlers in place. This provides consistency and reduces errors.

Centralization of logging information can be done via configuring the file with JSON/YAML. Let us understand both these approaches separately.

### JSON Configuration

In this example, you shall learn how to use a JSON configuration for logging:

```yaml
{
  'version': 1,
  'disable_existing_loggers': false,
  'formatters':
    { 'standard': { 'format': '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s' } },
  'handlers':
    {
      'console':
        {
          'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
          'formatter': 'standard',
          'level': 'DEBUG',
          'stream': 'ext://sys.stdout',
        },
    },
  'loggers': { '': { 'handlers': ['console'], 'level': 'DEBUG', 'propagate': true } },
}
```

Further, use this configuration in Python script:

```python
import logging
import logging.config
import json

# Load logging configuration from JSON file
with open('logging_config.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Configure logging
logging.config.dictConfig(config)

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Example log messages
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

### YAML Configuration

Follow the steps to create logging_config.yaml file:

```yaml
version: 1
disable_existing_loggers: false
formatters:
  standard:
    format: '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s'
handlers:
  console:
    class: logging.StreamHandler
    formatter: standard
    level: DEBUG
    stream: ext://sys.stdout
loggers:
  '':
    handlers: [console]
    level: DEBUG
    propagate: true
```

Next, use this configuration in your Python script:

```python
import logging
import logging.config
import yaml

# Load logging configuration from YAML file
with open('logging_config.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Configure logging
logging.config.dictConfig(config)

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Example log messages
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```

With the use of JSON or YAML configurations for logging, you can enhance the flexibility and manageability of your logging setups, leading to more maintainable and adaptable tools.

## Avoid Logging Sensitive Information

Ensuring security and privacy is one of the major concerns in software development. The best practice to address this critical issue is by avoiding logging sensitive information. If sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, personal identification information, and other confidential details are logged and then accessed by unauthorized individuals it will lead to significant security threat.

### Implementation in Python

### Strategies to Avoid Logging Sensitive Information

1. Redaction: You should hide sensitive information before logging.
2. Conditional Logging: Use conditions to avoid logging sensitive information.
3. Custom Logging Filters: Create custom logging filters to remove sensitive information.

Let us now look at the implementation of these strategies:

### Redaction

```python
import logging
import re

class RedactingFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    def format(self, record):
        message = super().format(record)
        # Redact sensitive information using regex
        redacted_message = re.sub(r'\bpassword\b', '**', message, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
        return redacted_message

# Setup logger
logger = logging.getLogger('secureLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = RedactingFormatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# Example usage
logger.debug("User logged in with password: 12345")
logger.info("This is an info message without sensitive data.")
```

Output:

```
2024-07-12 09:37:06,037 - secureLogger - DEBUG - User logged in with **: 12345
2024-07-12 09:37:06,037 - secureLogger - INFO - This is an info message without sensitive data.
```

In this example, the `RedactingFormatter` replaces any instance of the password with asterisks.

### Conditional Logging

```python
import logging

# Setup logger
logger = logging.getLogger('conditionalLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# Function to log conditionally
def log_info(message):
    if "password" not in message:
        logger.info(message)
    else:
        logger.warning("Attempted to log sensitive information!")

# Example usage
log_info("This is an info message without sensitive data.")
log_info("User logged in with password: 12345")

```

Output:

```
2024-07-08 00:21:01,526 - conditionalLogger - INFO - This is an info message without sensitive data.
2024-07-08 00:21:01,526 - conditionalLogger - WARNING - Attempted to log sensitive information!
```

In this example, the `log_info` function checks the message for sensitive information before logging it.

### Custom Logging Filters

```python
import logging

class SensitiveInfoFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        # Remove sensitive information
        if "password" in record.msg:
            return False
        return True

# Setup logger
logger = logging.getLogger('filterLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# Add filter to logger
sensitive_info_filter = SensitiveInfoFilter()
logger.addFilter(sensitive_info_filter)

# Example usage
logger.info("This is an info message without sensitive data.")
logger.info("User logged in with password: 12345")

```

Output:

```
2024-07-12 09:31:13,672 - filterLogger - INFO - This is an info message without sensitive data.
```

In this example, the `SensitiveInfoFilter` prevents any log message containing the word "password" from being logged.

## Avoid Root Logger

One of the best practices while logging in python is to avoid root logger. Root logger is the default logger instance created by the logging module. It is a convenient method, though it reduces code flexibility. It is better to create and configure named loggers for your application. The use of appropriate named loggers provide more granularity, isolation and clarity to the code.

Named loggers in Python's logging module are instances of the `Logger` class that are given specific names. These names help to identify and categorize log messages, making it easier to control logging behavior and manage log output from different parts of an application. Named loggers can be hierarchical, which means they can have parent-child relationships. This allows for fine-grained control over logging configuration.

### Implementation in Python

### Creating and Configuring Named Loggers

Let us learn to create and configure named loggers in Python.

```python
import logging

# Configure the root logger minimally or not at all
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)  # Optional: Minimal configuration for the root logger

# Create and configure a named logger
def setup_logger(name, log_file, level=logging.INFO):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(level)

    # Create handlers
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()

    # Create formatters and add them to handlers
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    # Add handlers to the logger
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)

    return logger

# Set up different named loggers
app_logger = setup_logger('appLogger', 'app.log')
db_logger = setup_logger('dbLogger', 'db.log', level=logging.DEBUG)

# Example usage
app_logger.info("This is an info message from the application.")
app_logger.error("This is an error message from the application.")

db_logger.debug("This is a debug message from the database module.")
db_logger.warning("This is a warning message from the database module.")

```

Output:

```
2024-07-08 00:23:04,943 - appLogger - INFO - This is an info message from the application.
INFO:appLogger:This is an info message from the application.
2024-07-08 00:23:04,943 - appLogger - ERROR - This is an error message from the application.
ERROR:appLogger:This is an error message from the application.
2024-07-08 00:23:04,943 - dbLogger - DEBUG - This is a debug message from the database module.
DEBUG:dbLogger:This is a debug message from the database module.
2024-07-08 00:23:04,943 - dbLogger - WARNING - This is a warning message from the database module.
WARNING:dbLogger:This is a warning message from the database module.

```

## Write Meaningful Logs

For an enhanced ability to monitor, debug, and maintain an application one should always write meaningful logs. They give clear and useful information that helps developers and system administrators understand the workings of the application, identify issues, and track application behavior over time.

### Principles for Writing Meaningful Logs

1. Clarity and Conciseness: Logs need to be clear and concise that provide the required context only.
2. Contextual Information: Logs should only include relevant information to provide proper context.
3. Consistency: A consistent format for all log messages needs to be followed throughout an application.
4. Appropriate Log Levels: The correct log level needs to be used to reflect the severity and nature of the event being logged.
5. Actionable Information: Logs should provide information that can be acted upon.

### Examples of Meaningful Logs

### Example 1: Logging a Function Entry with Parameters

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

def process_order(order_id, user_id):
    logger.debug(f"Entered process_order function with order_id={order_id}, user_id={user_id}")
    # Processing logic
    logger.info(f"Order {order_id} processed successfully for user {user_id}")

# Example usage
process_order(123, 456)
```

Output:

```
2024-07-08 00:24:04,342 - exampleLogger - DEBUG - Entered process_order function with order_id=123, user_id=456
2024-07-08 00:24:04,342 - exampleLogger - INFO - Order 123 processed successfully for user 456
```

### Example 2: Logging an Error with Context

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        logger.info(f"Division successful: {a} / {b} = {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logger.error(f"Failed to divide {a} by {b}: Division by zero", exc_info=True)

# Example usage
divide_numbers(10, 0)
```

Output:

```
2024-07-08 00:24:47,032 - exampleLogger - ERROR - Failed to divide 10 by 0: Division by zero
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/falcon/Desktop/signoz-python-logging/main.py", line 13, in divide_numbers
    result = a / b
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

### Example 3: Logging a Warning with a Specific Condition

```python
import logging

# Create a logger with the name 'exampleLogger'
logger = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')
# Set the logging level to DEBUG, so all messages of this level and above will be logged
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a console handler to output logs to the console
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
# Define a formatter to specify the format of the log messages
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
# Set the formatter for the console handler
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
# Add the console handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

def check_inventory(item_id, quantity):
    """
    Check the inventory for the given item and quantity.
    Log a warning if the inventory is low, otherwise log an info message.

    :param item_id: The ID of the item to check
    :param quantity: The quantity of the item requested
    """
    # Example inventory dictionary with item IDs and their available quantities
    inventory = {"item1": 10, "item2": 5}

    # Check if the requested quantity is greater than the available quantity in the inventory
    if inventory.get(item_id, 0) < quantity:
        # Log a warning if the inventory is low
        logger.warning(f"Low inventory for item {item_id}: requested {quantity}, available {inventory.get(item_id, 0)}")
    else:
        # Log an info message if the inventory check passes
        logger.info(f"Inventory check passed for item {item_id}: requested {quantity}, available {inventory.get(item_id, 0)}")

# Example usage of the check_inventory function
check_inventory("item1", 15)

```

Output:

```
2024-07-08 00:25:17,706 - exampleLogger - WARNING - Low inventory for item item1: requested 15, available 10
```

## Use Rotating Logs

One of the best python practices in logging is the use of rotating logs. The use of rotating logs helps to prevent log files from growing indefinitely, which can consume maximum disk space making log management difficult. They improve performance and organization of log files. The `logging` module in Python provides handlers such as `RotatingFileHandler` and `TimedRotatingFileHandler` to facilitate log rotation.

### Implementation in Python

### Using `RotatingFileHandler`

`RotatingFileHandler` rotates logs based on file size. When the log file reaches a certain size, it is renamed, and a new log file is created.

```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger('rotatingLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a handler for rotating logs
handler = RotatingFileHandler(
    'app.log', maxBytes=1024*5, backupCount=3  # 5 KB per file, 3 backup files
)

# Create a formatter and set it for the handler
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(handler)

# Example usage
for i in range(100):
    logger.debug(f"This is log message {i}")

```

In this example:

- `maxBytes` specifies the maximum file size (5 KB in this case) before rotation occurs.
- `backupCount` specifies the number of backup files to keep. Old files will be deleted when this limit is reached.

### Using `TimedRotatingFileHandler`

`TimedRotatingFileHandler` rotates logs based on time intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).

```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import TimedRotatingFileHandler

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger('timedRotatingLogger')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a handler for timed rotating logs
handler = TimedRotatingFileHandler(
    'timed_app.log', when='midnight', interval=1, backupCount=7
)

# Create a formatter and set it for the handler
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(handler)

# Example usage
for i in range(100):
    logger.debug(f"This is log message {i}")

```

Explanation:

- `when='midnight'` specifies that log rotation should occur at midnight.
- `interval=1` indicates the frequency of rotation (every 1 day in this case).
- `backupCount=7` specifies the number of backup files to keep (one week of daily logs).

Output:

When using `RotatingFileHandler` with the above configuration, you might see log files like:

```
app.log
app.log.1
app.log.2
app.log.3
```

When using `TimedRotatingFileHandler`, you shall see log files like:

```
timed_app.log
timed_app.log.2024-07-01
timed_app.log.2024-07-02
...
```

## Scaling logs

As the complexity of an application increases, scaling log becomes significant in monitoring, debugging, and analyzing application behavior.
Several strategies for scaling logs are as follows:

1. Distributed Logging: Implement a distributed logging architecture where logs are collected from multiple sources and centralized for storage and analysis. This approach helps distribute the load and ensures that logs are accessible from a central location.
2. Log Aggregation: Use log aggregation tools or services (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, Sumo Logic) to consolidate logs from various sources into a centralized repository. These tools often provide advanced querying and visualization capabilities for analyzing log data.
3. Asynchronous Logging: Use asynchronous logging to improve application performance. Asynchronous logging allows the application to continue running without waiting for the log messages to be written to disk or sent over the network.
4. Batch Processing: Batch log messages to reduce the overhead of logging operations. Instead of writing each log message individually, batch them together and write them in larger chunks.
5. Log Compression: Compress log files to reduce storage costs and improve transfer speeds, especially when shipping logs over the network to a centralized location.
6. Horizontal Scaling: Scale your logging infrastructure horizontally by adding more logging nodes or instances. This approach ensures that the logging system can handle increased load and redundancy in case of failures.
7. Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute incoming log messages across multiple logging nodes or services. This helps evenly distribute the workload and ensures high availability.
8. Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively monitor the health and performance of your logging infrastructure. Set up alerts for high log volumes, errors in logging, or infrastructure failures.

## Handle Exceptions Gracefully

Proper handling of exceptions is essential while logging in Python. It ensures that the application remains stable, providing meaningful feedback during failures and helps in troubleshooting issues. Let us see how to handle exceptions gracefully and integrate logs effectively.

### Best Practices for Handling Exceptions and Logging

1. Use Try-Except Blocks:

   - Wrap code likely to raise exceptions in `try-except` blocks.
   - Log exceptions with relevant context to aid in debugging.

   ```python
   import logging

   # Configure logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   try:
       # Code that may raise exceptions
       result = 10 / 0  # Example division by zero to trigger an exception
   except ZeroDivisionError as e:
       logger.error("Division by zero occurred", exc_info=True)
       # Optionally, handle the exception (e.g., notify, recover, fallback)

   ```

   Output :

   ```
   	ERROR:__main__:Division by zero occurred
   	Traceback (most recent call last):
   	  File "/Users/falcon/Desktop/signoz-python-logging/main.py", line 9, in <module>
   	    result = 10 / 0  # Example division by zero to trigger an exception
   	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

   ```

2. Log Contextual Information:

   - Include additional context in log messages, such as variable values or the current state of the application.

   ```python
   try:
       # Code that may raise exceptions
       item = inventory[item_id]
   except KeyError as e:
       logger.error(f"Item {item_id} not found in inventory", exc_info=True)

   ```

3. Use Exception Hierarchy:

   - Handle specific exceptions separately to provide tailored error messages and actions.

   ```python
   try:
       # Code that may raise exceptions
       file = open('file.txt', 'r')
   except FileNotFoundError as e:
       logger.error("File not found: file.txt", exc_info=True)
   except IOError as e:
       logger.error("IOError occurred while opening file", exc_info=True)

   ```

4. Ensure Logging Configuration:

   - Configure logging settings, such as log level and output format, to suit your application's needs.

   ```python
   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(
       filename='app.log',
       format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
       level=logging.INFO
   )

   ```

5. Centralize Exception Handling:

   - Use a centralized mechanism for logging exceptions across your application to maintain consistency and simplify maintenance.

   ```python
   def process_data(data):
       try:
           # Code that may raise exceptions
           result = data / 0
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error("An error occurred during data processing", exc_info=True)
           # Optionally, raise or handle the exception appropriately

   def main():
       try:
           # Main application logic
           process_data(some_data)
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error("Unexpected error occurred", exc_info=True)
           # Optionally, handle or re-raise the exception

   ```

## Test and Monitor Logs

Testing and monitoring logs are important practices that ensure the working of logging system correctly. It helps to capture relevant information and ensure reliability.

### Testing Logs

1. Unit Testing:

   - Write unit tests to validate that log messages are generated correctly under different scenarios.
   - Use mocking to simulate log events and verify the behavior of loggers and handlers.

   ```python
   import unittest
   import logging
   from unittest.mock import patch

   class TestLogging(unittest.TestCase):

       def test_logging(self):
           with patch('logging.Logger.error') as mock_error:
               logging.error('Error message')
               mock_error.assert_called_once_with('Error message')

   ```

2. Integration Testing:

   - Include tests that verify the integration of logging with other components of your application, such as error handling and data processing.

   ```python
   class TestIntegration(unittest.TestCase):

       def test_data_processing_with_logging(self):
           # Simulate data processing
           try:
               result = 10 / 0  # Example to trigger an exception
           except ZeroDivisionError:
               logging.error('Division by zero occurred')
               # Assert log message or expected behavior
               self.assertTrue(logging.error.called)

   ```

3. Coverage:

   - Ensure that log messages cover various scenarios, including edge cases, error conditions, and expected outputs.
   - Use code coverage tools to verify that logging statements are executed during tests.

   ```python
   class TestCoverage(unittest.TestCase):

       def test_critical_error_handling(self):
           try:
               # Trigger critical error
               raise RuntimeError('Critical error')
           except RuntimeError as e:
               logging.critical('Critical error occurred: %s', e)
               # Assert log message
               self.assertTrue(logging.critical.called)

   ```

## Asynchronous Logging

Asynchronous logging is used to improve performance of logging operations in Python applications. It is used when logging synchronously would introduce delays and affect the overall application speed. In this section, you will learn about the implementation of asynchronous logging. Asynchronous logging provides improved performance, non blocking feature and helps maintain application performance under heavy loads.

### Implementation Using `JsonLogger` (aiologger)

The `aiologger` library provides a `JsonLogger` specifically designed for asynchronous logging using Python's asyncio framework.

1.  Installation:
    Install `aiologger` using pip:

    ````
    pip install aiologger

        ```

    ````

2.  Example Implementation:

    ```python
     import asyncio
     from aiologger.loggers.json import JsonLogger

     async def main():
         # Create a logger instance with default handlers
         logger = JsonLogger.with_default_handlers(name="exampleLogger", level="DEBUG")

         # Generate log messages asynchronously
         for i in range(10):
             await logger.debug(f"This is log message {i}")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         asyncio.run(main())

    ```

Output:

```

```

### Explanation:

- JsonLogger: `JsonLogger.with_default_handlers()` is used here as an example to configure logging with a JSON format, suitable for structured logging.
- Logging Levels: Adjust the `level` parameter as needed (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) to control which log messages are processed by the handler.

## Structured Logging

Structured logging involves logging data in a structured format generally using JSON, key- value pairs, or other structured data formats. It offers many advantages over traditional logging method, It provides easier parsing, improved searchability, and better integration with log aggregation and analysis tools.

### Implementation Using `logging` Module in Python

Python’s built-in `logging` module can be configured to output structured log messages using a custom formatter. Here’s an example of structured logging using JSON format:

```python
import logging
import json

# Configure logging to output JSON format
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class StructuredMessage:
    def __init__(self, message, **kwargs):
        self.message = message
        self.kwargs = kwargs

    def __str__(self):
        return json.dumps({
            'message': self.message,
            **self.kwargs
        })

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.__str__()

    def as_dict(self):
        return {
            'message': self.message,
            **self.kwargs
        }

# Example usage
structured_log = StructuredMessage('User login', user_id=123, status='success')
logger.debug(structured_log)

```
