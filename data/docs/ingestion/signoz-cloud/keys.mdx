## Modify a Limit
To modify an existing limit, navigate to the Ingestion key and click the edit option corresponding to the limit in question. It's important to note that modifying a limit does not reset the accumulated values. For example, if the initial limit was 20GB/day and you've used 15GB before increasing the limit to 25GB/day, the usage count will continue from 15GB.

## Remove a Limit
To remove a limit, navigate to the Ingestion key and click the delete option next to the relevant limit. Deleting a limit will reset all accumulated values. For instance, if the limit was set to 20GB/day and you've used 15GB before deleting the limit, the counter will be reset to 0. Any new limit created thereafter will start from 0.
