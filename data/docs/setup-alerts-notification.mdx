## Setting a Notification Channel

As a first step before creating a new alert, you should set up a notification channel where you want to send your alert. There are multiple notification channels available to send your alerts. Here's how you can set the notification channel:

### Step 1: Open the Alert Channel Settings
To configure the appropriate notification channel, navigate to the Alert Channel settings (`Settings -> Alert Channel Tab`). This section contains a list of available channels that you have created.

### Step 2: Create a New Alert Channel
Click on the **`+ New Alert Channel`** button at the top right corner and fill in the details

#### Name
Assign a descriptive name to the notification channel in the "Name" field. This helps identify the channel when selecting it for alerts.

#### Send Resolved Alerts
The "Send Resolved Alerts" toggle lets you decide whether to send notifications when alerts are resolved. By default it is enabled.

#### Type
The "Type" dropdown menu lets you choose the type of notification channel. The following types are available:

- **[Slack](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/slack/)**: Sends alert notifications to Slack. You can select a specific Slack channel for alert notifications.
- **[Webhook](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/webhook/)**: Sends alert notifications to a custom webhook endpoint for integration with third-party systems or custom applications.
- **[Incident.io](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/incident-io/)**: Sends alert notifications to Incident.io for incident management.
- **[Rootly](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/rootly/)**: Sends alert notifications to Rootly for incident management.
- **[Zenduty](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/zenduty/)**: Sends alert notifications to Zenduty for incident management.
- **[PagerDuty](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/pagerduty/)**: Sends alert notifications to PagerDuty for advanced incident management. 
- **[Opsgenie](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/opsgenie/)**: Sends alert notifications to Opsgenie, an incident management platform.
- **[Email](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/email/)**: Sends alert notifications via email. You can specify one or more email addresses to receive alerts.
- **[Microsoft Teams](https://signoz.io/docs/alerts-management/notification-channel/ms-teams/)**: Sends alert notifications to Microsoft Teams, a collaboration platform. 


### Step 3: Test and Save
- **Test**: The "Test" button sends a test notification to verify that the channel is set up correctly and is functioning as expected.
- **Save**: This button saves the new notification channel.

Once the Notification Channel is saved, you should be able to select it when creating an Alert.
