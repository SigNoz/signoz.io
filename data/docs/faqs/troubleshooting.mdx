### How to run SigNoz in debug mode?

You might want to follow our troubleshooting docs.
Refer here:

- [SigNoz Troubleshooting Docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/troubleshooting/)

### How do I know if SigNoz is accessible from my Application?

We have a troubleshooting guide to check if  SigNoz is accessible from your application or not or, is the instrumentation not working or the application is not instrumented in the first place?

Set `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console` and observe. If it doesn’t output the traces to the stdout, the instrumentation is not working or your application isn’t correctly instrumented in the first place.

### I am not seeing all my services related to my application listed in the Services tab, what could be the potential reason?

We rely on the semantic conventions provided by OpenTelemetry. Every unique `service.name`
 configured and received is part of the service list. You can read more about it from our [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/metrics/#open-the-services-section).


### Facing Permission Issues in SigNoz

A. If you're seeing permission errors when creating new or editing dashboards, views, alerts, this is often caused by cached user permissions in your session. 
Solution — refresh your session permissions by logging out and back in:

### My services are not showing up in the Service Map section (but present in the services and traces tab), what should I do?

A. You might need to zoom out a bit to see your service.  
**Note:** Standalone services (without dependencies/calls to other services) are not shown in the Service Map. Only services with interdependencies (i.e., calls to other services) are visualized. For more details, refer to our [Service Map documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/service-map/).

<details>

<summary> Show detailed steps </summary>

1. Zoom out on the Service Map to ensure the service isn't off-screen.  
2. Confirm your services have inter-service calls (spans) — the Service Map visualizes dependencies, not standalone services.  
3. Verify instrumentation is sending spans with proper service.name and relevant span attributes.  
4. If needed, inspect traces in the Traces tab to confirm calls between services are present.
