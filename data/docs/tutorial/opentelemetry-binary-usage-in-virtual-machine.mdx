### Overview

This tutorial shows how you can deploy OpenTelemetry binary as an agent, which
collects telemetry data. Data such as traces, metrics and logs generated
by applications most likely running in the same virtual machine (VM).

It can also be used for collecting data from other VMs in the same cluster,
data center or region, however, binary is not recommended in that scenario but
container or deployment which can be easily scaled.

In this guide, you will also learn to set up a hostmetrics receiver to collect
metrics from the VM and view in SigNoz.

## Setup Otel Collector as agent

OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications in a VM can send data to the `otel-binary` agent running in the same VM. The OTel agent can then be configured to send data to the SigNoz cloud.

Here are the steps to set up OpenTelemetry binary as an agent.

1. Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

2. Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the `otelcol-contrib` folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

3. Create `config.yaml` in `otelcol-contrib` folder and paste the below yaml configuration code in it.

```YAML

4. Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

### Run in background 
If you want to run otel collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```
The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running otel collector process to the otel-pid file.

   
If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```
tail 50 will give the last 50 lines from the file `otelcol-output.log`


You can stop the collector service `otelcol` when running in backgorund, with the following command:

```bash
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```

OpenTelemetry collector binary should be able to forward all types of telemetry data received:
traces, metrics, and logs, to SigNoz OTLP endpoint via gRPC.

Let's send sample traces to the `otelcol` using `telemetrygen`.

To install telemetrygen binary:

```bash
go install github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/cmd/telemetrygen@latest
```

To send trace data using `telemetrygen`, execute the command below:

```bash
telemetrygen traces --traces 1 --otlp-endpoint localhost:4317 --otlp-insecure
```

Output should look like this:

```
...

```

If the SigNoz endpoint in the configuration is set correctly and accessible,
you should be able to see the traces sent via OpenTelemetry collector in VM
from `telemetrygen` in the SigNoz UI.

## Prerequisites

- SigNoz application up and running
- SigNoz endpoint accessible from the VM
- availability of ports: `4317`, `4318`, `8888`, `1777`, `13133`

## Installation

You can obtain the OpenTelemetry collector binary in the assets of each release:
[open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases][1].
There are two ways of installation with binary release assets: `deb` as
`systemd` and `tar.gz` as plain binary.

### Systemd

Using the `deb` file, OpenTelemetry Collector will be installed as a `systemd` and
default configuration prepopulated at the `/etc/otelcol-contrib` path. This method
would be preferable in case you want the OpenTelemetry collector to always be
running in the background.

To download the `deb` file of release version `0.116.0`:

Here are the steps to set up OpenTelemetry binary as an agent.

<Tabs groupId="systemd-arch">
<TabItem value="amd" label="amd64" default>

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.deb
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arm" label="arm64">

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_arm64.deb
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="info">
In the case of different OpenTelemetry collector versions, replace `0.116.0` with the respective version.
</Admonition>

To install `otelcol` as `systemd` using `dpkg`:

<Tabs groupId="systemd-arch">
<TabItem value="amd" label="amd64" default>

```bash
sudo dpkg -i otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.deb
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arm" label="arm64">

```bash
sudo dpkg -i otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_arm64.deb
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Plain Binary

Using the `tar.gz` release asset, we can extract the OpenTelemetry collector binary
and default configuration at our desired path. You can run the binary directly
with flags by using tools like `screen` or `tmux`.

<Tabs groupId="plainbin-arch">
<TabItem value="linux-amd" label="Linux (amd64)" default>

</Tabs>

## OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration

Let's download the standalone configuration for the `otelcol` binary running in the VM:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SigNoz/benchmark/main/docker/standalone/config.yaml
```

Replace `<IP of machine hosting SigNoz>` with the address to SigNoz in the configuration
highlighted below:

```yaml {3}
exporters:
   otlp:
     endpoint: "<IP of machine hosting SigNoz>:4317"
     tls:
       insecure: true
```

In the configuration above, we enable three receivers: `OTLP`, `hostmetrics`
and `prometheus`.

`OTLP` receiver is configured to receive all types of telemetry data:
traces, metrics, and logs. These data would be forwarded to SigNoz via
OTLP gRPC endpoint.

`hostmetrics` receiver is configured to collect various metrics of the virtual
machine. It consists of metrics related to CPU, memory, disk, file system,
network, and others.

`prometheus` receiver is configured to collect the internal metrics of the
`otelcol`. You can update it as per your need to include additional scrape
targets accessible from the VM or remove existing targets.

## OpenTelemetry Collector Usage

You copy the configuration file to the respective config paths as per your
installation methods. Followed by respective instructions to start, restart,
and view logs of the `otelcol` binary.

### Systemd

To copy the updated `config.yaml` file:

```bash
sudo cp config.yaml /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```

To restart `otelcol` with updated config:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart otelcol-contrib.service
```

To check the status of `otelcol`:

```bash
sudo systemctl status otelcol-contrib.service
```

To view logs of `otelcol`:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u otelcol-contrib.service
```

To stop `otelcol`:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop otelcol-contrib.service
```

### Plain Binary

It is recommended to use the `otelcol` binary inside the terminal multiplexer
tools like `tmux` or `screen`, since plain binary usage is ephemeral.

To copy the updated `config.yaml` file:

```bash
cp config.yaml ./otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```

To change the directory inside the `otelcol-contrib` folder:

```bash
cd otelcol-contrib
```

<Tabs groupId="plainbin-arch">
<TabItem value="linux-amd" label="Linux (amd64)" default>

Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

### Run in background 
If you want to run otel collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```
The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running otel collector process to the otel-pid file.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux-arm" label="Linux (arm64)">

Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

If you want to run otel collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$\!" > otel-pid
```
The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running otel collector process to the otel-pid file.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos-arm" label="MacOS (arm64)">

Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the `otelcol-contrib`, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

### Run in background 

If you want to run otel collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$\!" > otel-pid
```
The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running otel collector process to the otel-pid file.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To view the last 50 lines of `otelcol` logs:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

To stop `otelcol`:

```bash
kill "$(< otel-pid)"
```

## Test Sending Traces

OpenTelemetry collector binary should be able to forward all types of telemetry data received:
traces, metrics, and logs, to SigNoz OTLP endpoint via gRPC.

Let's send sample traces to the `otelcol` using `telemetrygen`.

To install telemetrygen binary:

```bash
go install github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/cmd/telemetrygen@latest
```

To send trace data using `telemetrygen`, execute the command below:

```bash
telemetrygen traces --traces 1 --otlp-endpoint localhost:4317 --otlp-insecure
```

The output should look like this:

```
