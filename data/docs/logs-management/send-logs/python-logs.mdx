You can send Python logs to SigNoz using Auto instrumentation which is the fast, no code change way to send logs to SigNoz.

## Prerequisites

- A [auto-instrumented](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-python/#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud) python application with logging implemented

## Setup

### Step 1: Instrument your application

Follow the steps in our [Python instrumentation document](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-python/#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud) to auto-instrument your application.


### Step 2: Run your application

Now, run your application with the following environment variables set:

```bash
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp \
OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

This attaches an OTLP log handler, injects trace context into each log record. This will allow you to correlate logs with traces.

- `OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED` when set to `true` will [attach the OTLP log handler](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/python/configuration/#logging) to the root logger. That is what sends the logs out.

## Python application on Kubernetes

If your application is running on Kubernetes, you can use the [k8s-infra-chart](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra/) to get your logs directly to SigNoz.

The chart has [presets.logsCollection.enabled](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/configure-k8s-infra/#3-container-log-collection) property to **true** which adds a `filelogreceiver`. This receiver is configured to read the files where Kubernetes 
container runtime writes all containers console output **(/var/log/pods/*/*/*.log)**.

### Parse attributes 

Once you have the logs in SigNoz, you can parse different attributes from the log body using [Logs Pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/).
Logs pipelines give you the ability to pre-process logs by providing you with a number of [log processors](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/processors/).
Checkout [these guides](https://signoz.io/docs/category/guides/) to learn how you can use logs pipelines for different use-cases.

## Fine Grained Control

If you need more control over your logging, you can use the OpenTelemetry Python SDK to manually instrument your application. It provides a handler that can be used to transport logs to any OTLP-compatible backend. 

Here are some references to get you started with manual instrumentation:
