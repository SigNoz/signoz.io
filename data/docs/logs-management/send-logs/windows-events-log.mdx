title: Windows Events log to SigNoz
id: windows_events_logs

## Overview

If you are using a Windows environment, you can stream Windows Event Logs to SigNoz using OpenTelemetry Collector. Monitoring specific Event Log sources, known as Channels, can be done using the Windows Event Log receiver configured in the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file.

Key channels typically monitored include:

- **Application:** Logs events related to applications running on the system.
- **Security:** Records security-related events such as login attempts and resource access.
- **System:** Captures events related to system components, drivers, and services.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft User account with permissions to access Event Log and Services.

## Setup

### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector

Install OpenTelemetry Collector as an agent by following the [SigNoz Cloud Installation Documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

### Step 2: Configure `windowseventlog` receiver

#### Add `windowseventlog` Receiver

Modify the `config.yaml` file to include the `windowseventlog` receiver for monitoring application and system logs:

```yaml
receivers:
    windowseventlog/application:
        channel: application
    windowseventlog/system:
        channel: system
```

#### Update Pipelines Configuration

In the same `config.yaml` file, update the `pipelines` section to include the `windowseventlog/application` and `windowseventlog/system` receivers:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [windowseventlog/application, windowseventlog/system]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Save the changes and restart the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Setup

### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector

Install OpenTelemetry Collector as an agent by following the [Self-Hosted SigNoz Installation Documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/self-host/install/).

### Step 2: Configure `windowseventlog` receiver

#### Add `windowseventlog` Receiver

Modify the `config.yaml` file to include the `windowseventlog` receiver for monitoring application and system logs:

```yaml
receivers:
    windowseventlog/application:
        channel: application
    windowseventlog/system:
        channel: system
```

#### Update Pipelines Configuration

In the same `config.yaml` file, update the `pipelines` section to include the `windowseventlog/application` and `windowseventlog/system` receivers:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [windowseventlog/application, windowseventlog/system]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Save the changes and restart the OpenTelemetry Collector.
