title: Send Logs from Vector to SigNoz

If you have [Vector](https://vector.dev/) running on your system, you can forward logs from Vector to SigNoz by following this guide. 


## Send Logs from Vector to SigNoz in SigNoz Cloud

* Update the vector `config.yaml` and add the following changes.
    ```yaml
    signoz_sink:
      type: http
      inputs:
        - <SOURCE_NAME>
      uri: https://ingest.<REGION>.signoz.cloud/logs/vector
      encoding:
        codec: json
      request:
        headers:
          signoz-access-token: "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
    ```

  Set the values of `<SOURCE_NAME>`, `<REGION>`  and  `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>`.

  `<SOURCE_NAME>` is the name of the source eg:- `docker` . Read about sources [here](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/).

  `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` is the ingestion key for SigNoz.

  Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the URI will vary according to this table.

  | Region | Endpoint                   |
  | ------ | -------------------------- |
  | US     | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | IN     | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | EU     | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

* Once the changes are applied, data will be sent to SigNoz from Vector.


# Mapping for SigNoz

* Any logs that you send, the `timestamp` will be parsed and the `source_type` will be moved to resource attributes.
* The `message` key will be mapped to `body`.
* You can transform your logs at Vector level to convert it to OTEL schema which will look like this.
  ```
  {
    "trace_id": <hex string>,
    "span_id": <hex string>,
    "trace_flags": <int>
    "severity_text": <string>,
    "severity_number": <int>,
    "attributes": <map>,
    "resources": <map>,
    "source_type": <string>,
    "message": <string>
  }
  ```

  Eg:-
  ```
  {
    "trace_id": "000000000000000018c51935df0b93b9",
    "span_id": "18c51935df0b93b9",
    "trace_flags": 0,
    "severity_text": "info",
    "severity_number": 4,
    "attributes": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/api/users"
    },
    "resources": {
        "host": "myhost",
        "namespace": "prod"
    },
    "source_type": "docker",
    "message": "This is a log line"
  }
  ```
* Any other keys which are not present in the above schema will be moved to log attributes.
* If you don't want to transform using Vector, you can transform using SigNoz [pipelines](https://signoz.io/docs/logs-pipelines/introduction/).
