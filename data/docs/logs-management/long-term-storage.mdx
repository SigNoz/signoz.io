title: Long Term Storage of Logs in SigNoz Cloud
---

import GetHelp from '@/components/shared/get-help.md'

Customers can configure in SigNoz for how many days they want to keep their data in Hot storage (faster query response) and how many days do they want to keep their data in Cold storage (slower query response). This option allows users to manage their costs even when storing logs data for long period of times for compliance and other needs.

The pricing for this plan is as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Hot Storage Period</th>
    <th colspan="5">Period in Cold Storage after Hot Storage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>0 day</th>
    <th>90 days</th>
    <th>180 days</th>
    <th>1 yr</th>
    <th>2 yrs</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.3</td>
    <td>0.45</td>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td>1.3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.4</td>
    <td>0.55</td>
    <td>0.7</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1.4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>90 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>0.75</td>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td>1.2</td>
    <td>1.6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>180 days (in $/GB)</td>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td>0.95</td>
    <td>1.1</td>
    <td>1.4</td>
    <td>1.8</td>
  </tr>
</table>
