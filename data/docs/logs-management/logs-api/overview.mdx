## Overview

The SigNoz Logs API is a robust interface which enables developers to manage and analyze log data efficiently. This API facilitates various operations:

- **Searching Logs:** Allows users to search through log data based on specific criteria. For example, finding all logs where the error code is 500.

- **Paginating Logs:** Helps in navigating through large sets of log data in a manageable way. For instance, retrieving logs in batches of 100 for easy viewing.

- **Aggregating Logs:** Enables summarizing log data to extract meaningful insights, such as aggregating logs to count the number of errors per day.
