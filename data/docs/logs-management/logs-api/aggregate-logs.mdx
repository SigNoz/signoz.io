This section demonstrates how to perform aggregation operations on log data using the SigNoz Logs API. The example provided focuses on counting distinct components and grouping the results by `container_id`

## Example of Aggregating Logs
The following example illustrates how to count distinct `component` values and group them by `container_id`. This can be useful for understanding the distribution of different components across various containers.

### Sample Payload
This is the JSON payload for the example described above for Aggregating Logs
