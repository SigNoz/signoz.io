title: Logs API Payload Model
id: payload-model
---

The SigNoz Logs API uses a JSON payload for queries, which includes various fields and nested fields. This document provides a detailed explanation of each field to help users construct effective queries.

### Top-level  

The top-level of the payload model has the following fields:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|start| Epoch timestamp marking the start of the query range (in milliseconds) |
|end | Epoch timestamp marking the end of the query range (in milliseconds) |
|requestType | Type of response expected (e.g., time_series, scalar, raw) |
|compositeQuery | This contains the [**compositeQuery**](#composite-query) which is explained below |
|variables | Variables for templated queries (optional) |

### Composite Query

The `compositeQuery` field consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|queries | Array of [**query envelopes**](#query-envelope) |

### Query Envelope

Each query in the `queries` array consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|type | Type of query (e.g., builder_query, builder_formula, clickhouse_sql, promql). Scope of this documentation is limited to **builder_query** type |
|spec | Query specification based on type - contains the [**builderQuery**](#builder-query) for builder_query type |

### Builder Query

A `builderQuery` spec consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|name | Name of the query (e.g., A, B, C) |
|signal | Source of data (e.g., logs, traces, metrics) |
|stepInterval| Aggregation interval for query in seconds |
|aggregations | Array of [**aggregation**](#aggregation) expressions |
|filter | [**filter**](#filter) expression for filtering data |
|groupBy| Array of [**groupByKey**](#groupby-key) used for groupBy |
|order | Array of [**orderBy**](#orderby) for sorting |
|limit | Maximum number of results to return |
|offset | Offset used in pagination |
|disabled| Specifies if the query is disabled |

### Aggregation

An `aggregation` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|expression | Aggregation expression - count(), count_distinct(field), sum(field), avg(field), min(field), max(field), p50(field), p75(field), p90(field), p95(field), p99(field) |
|alias | Optional alias for the aggregation result |

### Filter

A `filter` consists of:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|expression | Filter expression string using operators like `=, !=, >, >=, <, <=, IN, NOT IN, CONTAINS, NOT CONTAINS, REGEXP, NOT REGEXP, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS` |

### GroupBy Key

The `groupByKey` includes:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|name | Name of the field |
|fieldDataType | Data type of the field (e.g., string, int64, float64, bool) |
|fieldContext | Type of the field, i.e., attribute/resource |

### OrderBy

The `orderBy` includes:

|  NAME  | DESCRIPTION  |
|---|---|
|key | Object containing the field name to order by |
|direction | Sort direction (asc, desc) |

## Sample Payload

This sample payload contains the different fields that we looked at above. It queries the SigNoz Logs API and illustrates how to count distinct `component` values and group them by `container_id`.
