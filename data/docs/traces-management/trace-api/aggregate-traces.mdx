title: Aggregate Traces
id: aggregate-traces
---

This section demonstrates how to perform aggregation operations on trace data using the SigNoz Trace API.

## Aggregation Example

This example is useful for scenarios where you need to count occurrences of specific values (e.g., customer) and group them by another attribute (e.g., serviceName).

### Query Description

- **Objective**: Count customer values and group them by serviceName
- **Attributes**:
  - **aggregateAttribute**: `customer`
  - **groupBy**: `serviceName`

### Sample Payload

This is the JSON payload for the example query.

```json
{
    "start": 1702019380000,
    "end": 1702021180000,

                }
            }
