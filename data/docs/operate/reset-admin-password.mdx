title: Reset Admin Password
---

In case you have forgotten the root admin password, you can reset it by removing all users, organisation and invites from the SQLite database.

Starting from v0.76.0, multiple services (Query Service, Frontend, and Alertmanager) have been merged into a single `signoz` binary/image. Please follow the  steps below based on your SigNoz version.

<TabItem label="Version >= 0.76.0" value=">=0.76.0" default>
The guide mainly covers the following:
- Exec into the `signoz` container
- Remove all users, organisation and invites using SQLite shell
- Restart the `signoz` container

## Exec into `signoz` Container

### Docker Standalone

```bash
docker exec -it signoz-signoz sh
```

### Docker Swarm

```bash
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name=signoz_signoz) sh
```

<Admonition type="info">
Replace `signoz` with your Docker stack name.
</Admonition>

### Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl -n platform exec -it pod/my-release-signoz-signoz-0 -- sh
```

<Admonition type="info">
Replace `my-release` with your Helm release name. And `platform` with your
SigNoz namespace.
</Admonition>

## Steps to Remove All Users, Organisation and Invites

### Step 1: Install SQLite and Connect to the Database File

```bash
apk update
apk add sqlite

sqlite3 /var/lib/signoz/signoz.db
```

### Step 2: Remove All Users and Organisation

In the sqlite shell, run the following commands:

```bash
select * from users;
select * from organizations;
select * from invites;

delete from users;
delete from organizations;
delete from invites;
```

### Step 3: Verify the Users, Organisation and Invites are Removed

```bash
select * from users;

select * from organizations;

select * from invites;
```

### Step 4: Exit from SQLite Shell and Container Shell

To exit from the sqlite shell, press `CTRL + D` and then exit from the
`signoz` container.

### Step 5: Restart the `signoz-signoz` Container

To restart the `signoz` container, run the following command:

**For Docker Users**

```bash
docker restart signoz-signoz
```

**For Docker Swarm Users**

```bash
docker service update --force signoz_signoz
```

**For Kubernetes Users**

```bash
kubectl -n platform rollout restart statefulset/my-release-signoz-signoz
```

Now, you should be able to create a new admin account from SigNoz UI: `http://localhost:3301`.
