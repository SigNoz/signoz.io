## Upgrade Instructions

### Docker Standalone

Before upgrading, add the following environment variable to your `clickhouse` service:

```yaml
services:
  clickhouse:
    image: clickhouse/clickhouse-server:25.5.6
    environment:
      - CLICKHOUSE_SKIP_SETUP_USER=1
```

Then follow the [standard upgrade guide](/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#docker-standalone).

### Docker Swarm

Before upgrading, ensure your Swarm stack's `clickhouse` service sets the image and env var as below, then follow the Standard Upgrade Guide.

```yaml
services:
  clickhouse:
    image: clickhouse/clickhouse-server:25.5.6
    environment:
      - CLICKHOUSE_SKIP_SETUP_USER=1
```

Then follow the [standard upgrade guide](/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#docker-swarm-cluster).

### Kubernetes

Follow the [standard upgrade guide](/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#kubernetes). Ensure your ClickHouse version is `25.5.6` (set the ClickHouse image tag to `25.5.6`) before starting SigNoz v0.94.0.

<Admonition type="warning">
If you encounter issues with ClickHouse not updating or pods failing during the upgrade, you can manually patch the ClickHouse resource using the following commands:
```bash
kubectl patch chi -n <YOUR_SIGNOZ_INSTALLATION_NAMESPACE> signoz-clickhouse --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/templates/podTemplates/0/spec/containers/0/image","value":"docker.io/clickhouse/clickhouse-server:25.5.6"}]'

kubectl patch chi -n <YOUR_SIGNOZ_INSTALLATION_NAMESPACE> signoz-clickhouse --type='merge' \
  -p '{"spec":{"restart":"RollingUpdate"}}'
```
</Admonition>

### Linux Binary Installation

Follow the [standard upgrade guide](/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#linux-binary-installation), ensuring your ClickHouse is on 25.5.6 before starting SigNoz v0.94.0.
