title: Upgrade to v0.92.0 (QBv5 and Cobra Cli Migration)
---

## Overview

SigNoz v0.92.0 introduces significant improvements that enhance both the user experience and system architecture:

- **Query Builder v5 (QBv5)**: Features expression-based querying with intelligent auto-completion, providing an improved user experience with a streamlined interface, better performance, and reliability. Complete documentation is available at the [Query Builder v5 Guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder-v5/)
- **Cobra CLI Migration**: SigNoz has migrated to a Cobra CLI structure that simplifies command organization, offers a better help system, and enhances maintainability and extensibility (related to [GitHub issue #6805](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/6805))
- **ClickHouse 25.5.6 Support**: We now support ClickHouse 25.5.6 to enhance database performance and compatibility. To upgrade, just replace 24.1.2 with 25.5.6, and no special steps needed.

## Upgrade Instructions
<Admonition type="info">
For upgrading to v0.92.0 you don't need to run any migrations manually to update dashboards, alerts and saved views as there is already an automatic migration in place to take care of the migration process.

### Docker Standalone

Follow the [standard upgrade guide](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#docker-standalone) and use the image tag `v0.92.0` for `signoz`. You can keep the other components, such as schema-migrator and signoz-otel-collector images, unchanged.

### Docker Swarm

Follow the [standard upgrade guide](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#docker-swarm-cluster) and use the image tag `v0.92.0` for `signoz`. You can leave the other components such as schema-migrator and signoz-otel-collector images unchanged.

### Kubernetes

Follow the [standard upgrade guide](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-standard/#kubernetes) and use the image tag `v0.92.0` for `signoz`. You can leave other components such as schema-migrator and signoz-otel-collector images unchanged.

### Linux Binary Installation

Since the Cobra CLI has been updated, the `signoz` binary now needs the `server` subcommand. Here's how to upgrade:

#### Step 1: Stop SigNoz Services

```bash
sudo systemctl stop signoz.service
sudo systemctl stop signoz-otel-collector.service
```

#### Step 2: Download Latest Binaries

The following commands automatically detect your system architecture:

```bash
# Download SigNoz binary
curl -L https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/latest/download/signoz_linux_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g' | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/g').tar.gz -o signoz.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar -xzf signoz.tar.gz
```

#### Step 3: Replace Binaries

```bash
# Install new binaries
sudo cp -r signoz_linux_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g' | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/g')/* /opt/signoz

# Fix file ownership
sudo chown -R signoz:signoz /opt/signoz
```

#### Step 4: Update systemd Service

Create the updated service file:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/signoz.service
[Unit]
Description=SigNoz
Documentation=https://signoz.io/docs
After=clickhouse-server.service

[Service]
User=signoz
Group=signoz
Type=simple
KillMode=mixed
Restart=on-failure
WorkingDirectory=/opt/signoz
EnvironmentFile=/opt/signoz/conf/systemd.env
ExecStart=/opt/signoz/bin/signoz server

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF'
```

#### Step 5: Start and Verify Services

1. **Reload systemd and start services:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start signoz.service
   ```

2. **Check service status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status signoz.service
   ```
   
   The service should show **`active (running)`** status.

3. **Verify application health:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
   ```
   
   Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`

4. **Test the UI:** 
   Open your SigNoz interface in a browser to ensure everything works correctly.
