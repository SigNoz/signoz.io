title: Using External ClickHouse

It is recommended to use the ClickHouse instance that is deployed along with SigNoz.
However, if you want to use an external ClickHouse instance, you can do so by relevant
instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Must have at least one Zookeeper instance
- Distributed cluster named `cluster` set up required: [clickhouse-cluster.xml][3]
- User credentaials passed must have enough privileges to create/manage databases and tables
- Secure connection is not supported between SigNoz and ClickHouse yet
- (Optional) UDF script and histogram quantile binary required: [custom-function.xml][1]
and [histogramQuantile binary][2]

<Admonition type="info">
The name of the cluster must be `cluster` as it is hardcoded in the SigNoz OtelCollector
migration files due to the limitations of `golang-migrate` library.
</Admonition>

## Setting up ClickHouse

1. Run at least an instance of Zookeeper.
2. Create configuration for distributed cluster named `cluster` as described in
    [clickhouse-cluster.xml][3] and include it in `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/`.
3. Include Zookeeper information in above [clickhouse-cluster.xml][3] file as well.
4. (Optional) Below steps are only required if you want to use _histogram quantile_ 
    functions using **Query Builder**.
    - Include [custom function configuration][1] in the `/etc/clickhouse-server/` directory.
    - Include [histogram quantile binary][2] in the `/var/lib/clickhouse/user_scripts/` directory.
5. Run at least an instance of ClickHouse with the above configuration.

## For Docker and Docker Swarm Users

In Docker and Docker Swarm, we will be modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file to use an
external ClickHouse.

1. Comment out `clickhouse` and `zookeeper` services in `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Comment out `x-clickhouse-defaults` and `x-clickhouse-depend` sections
    in `docker-compose.yml`.
3. Replace `clickhouse:9000` with relavant ClickHouse endpoint and TCP port in the files below:
    - `docker-compose.yaml`
    - `otel-collector-config.yaml`
    - `prometheus-config.yml`
4. Start SigNoz using relevant instructions.

## For Kubernetes Users

In Kubernetes, we will update `override-values.yaml` file to use an external ClickHouse.

At first, we will disable the default ClickHouse instance by setting `clickhouse.enabled` to `false`.
Then, we will include the external ClickHouse information in the `externalClickhouse` section.

_override-values.yaml_

```yaml
clickhouse:
  enabled: false

externalClickhouse:
  host: <clickhouse-endpoint>
  httpPort: 8123
  tcpPort: 9000
  cluster: cluster
  secure: false
  user: <ch-user>
  password: <ch-password>
```

To install SigNoz using the above configuration, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl create namespace platform
helm --namespace platform install my-release signoz/signoz -f override-values.yaml
```
