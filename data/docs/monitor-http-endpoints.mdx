<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

## Basic Setup

### Step 1: Install OpenTelemetry Collector

Install and set up the OpenTelemetry Collector by following the [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

### Step 2: Configure the HTTP Check Receiver

Add the [httpcheck receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md) to your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://example.com //replace with the endpoint you want to monitor
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 10s

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>"
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

### Step 3: Configure the Service Pipeline

Configure the service pipeline to include the httpcheck receiver:

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Step 4: Start the Collector

Start the OpenTelemetry Collector to begin collecting HTTP endpoint metrics:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

## Basic Setup

### Step 1: Configure the HTTP Check Receiver

Add the [httpcheck receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md) to your Collector configuration:

```yaml:config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://example.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 10s
```

### Step 2: Configure the Service Pipeline

Configure the service pipeline to include the `httpcheck` receiver:

```yaml:config.yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhousemetricswrite]
```

### Step 3: Restart the Collector

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector to begin collecting HTTP endpoint metrics.

## Understanding HTTP Check Metrics

The HTTP Check Receiver performs synthetic checks - a form of synthetic monitoring, against HTTP endpoints by making requests to specified endpoints using the configured method. It generates metrics labeled for each HTTP response status class.

The receiver creates a metric named `httpcheck_status` with value 1 if the check resulted in status_code matching the status_class, otherwise 0.

## Monitoring Multiple Endpoints

You can configure multiple `targets` for the httpcheck receiver to monitor several endpoints simultaneously:

```yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://example.com
        method: GET
      - endpoint: http://my-app.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 10s
```

## Multiple Collection Intervals

If you need different collection intervals for different endpoints, create multiple httpcheck receiver instances. Each instance can have its own collection interval and targets:

```yaml
receivers:
  httpcheck/rapid:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://critical-service.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 30s
  
  httpcheck/frequent:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://important-service.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 60s
  
  httpcheck/low:
    targets:
      - endpoint: http://background-service.com
        method: GET
    collection_interval: 300s

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, httpcheck/rapid, httpcheck/frequent, httpcheck/low]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Note:** The receiver name format is `httpcheck` for the base receiver and `httpcheck/{name}` for additional instances. Using `httpchecklow` (without the slash) would return an error.

## Creating Dashboards in SigNoz

Once the collector is running and sending data to SigNoz, you can create dashboards to visualize HTTP endpoint health:

### Step 1: Create a New Dashboard

1. Navigate to your SigNoz account
2. Go to the **Dashboard** tab
3. Click on **New Dashboard** button
4. Choose **New Panel** and select **Time Series** chart type for HTTP endpoint monitoring

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/time-series-chart.webp" alt="Selecting Time Series chart type"/>
    <figcaption><i>Selecting Time Series chart type for HTTP monitoring</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 2: Configure the Query

1. In the **Query Builder** tab, enter "http" in the metric search
2. You should see `httpcheck.status` and other HTTP-related metrics

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/query-builder-metrics.webp" alt="HTTP metrics in Query Builder"/>
    <figcaption><i>HTTP metrics available in Query Builder</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. Select `httpcheck.status` as your metric
4. Add a **WHERE** clause: `http.status_class = 2xx` to monitor successful responses

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/configure-query.webp" alt="Configuring httpcheck_status query"/>
    <figcaption><i>Configuring httpcheck.status query with WHERE clause</i></figcaption>
</figure>

5. You can also Average By specific endpoints using the `http.url` attribute

### Step 3: Visualize Endpoint Health

The resulting chart will show:
- Value of 1 when endpoints are healthy (returning 2xx status codes)
- Value of 0 when endpoints are down or returning error codes
- Different lines for each monitored endpoint

    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/endpoint-health-chart.webp" alt="HTTP endpoint health visualization"/>

</figure>

## Available Metrics

The HTTP Check receiver provides several metrics:

| Metric | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `httpcheck.status` | HTTP response status (1 for matching status class, 0 otherwise) | Sum |
| `httpcheck.duration` | Duration of the HTTP request in milliseconds | Gauge |
| `httpcheck.error` | Number of errors during HTTP checks | Sum |

## Available Attributes

Key attributes for filtering and grouping:

| Attribute | Description | Example Values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `http.url` | Full HTTP request URL | `http://example.com`, `http://my-app.com/health` |
| `http.status_code` | HTTP response status code | `200`, `404`, `500` |
| `http.method` | HTTP request method | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` |
| `http.status_class` | HTTP response status class | `2xx`, `4xx`, `5xx` |

For more details about the metrics and their related attributes, refer to the [HTTP Check Receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/httpcheckreceiver/documentation.md).

## Setting Up Alerts

You can create alerts to get notified when endpoints go down:

### Step 1: Create Alert from Dashboard

1. In your dashboard panel showing HTTP endpoint health, click the dropdown menu
2. Select **Create Alerts**

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/create-alert-dropdown.webp" alt="Creating alert from dashboard panel"/>
    <figcaption><i>Creating alert from dashboard panel dropdown</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. This will take you to the alerts configuration page

### Step 2: Configure Alert Conditions

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/monitor-http-endpoints/alert-configuration.webp" alt="Alert configuration page"/>
    <figcaption><i>Alert configuration page with conditions setup</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Example alert configuration:
```yaml
Metrics: httpcheck.status         
WHERE: http.status_class = 2xx 
Avg By: http.url


condition: below the threshold at least once during the last 5 mins
threshold: 1   
```

The alert fires when any of the monitored endpoint does not respond with 2xx (success) response (even once) during a 5-minute window.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **No metrics appearing**: Check that the httpcheck receiver is included in the metrics pipeline
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the collector has network access to the target endpoints
- **SSL/TLS errors**: Configure appropriate TLS settings for HTTPS endpoints
- **High resource usage**: Reduce collection frequency for non-critical endpoints
