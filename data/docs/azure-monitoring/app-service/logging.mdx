## Overview
The following categories of App Service Logs are available to export to Storage Account or EventHub. 

- HTTP logs
- App Service Console Logs
- App Service Application Logs
- Access Audit Logs
- IPSecurity Audit logs
- App Service Platform logs

Although, the application logs could be sent directly in the Application Level using a Opentelemetry Log Appender, this might not be an ideal solution for legacy software or micro-services model. It’s easier to do centralised logging for both application logs, system logs and SIEM Audit logs.

### Prerequisites

- [EventHub Setup](../../bootstrapping/data-ingestion)
- [Central Collector Setup](../../bootstrapping/collector-setup)
