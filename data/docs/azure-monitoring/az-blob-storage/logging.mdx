## Overview

Blob Storage Audit Logging is a feature of Azure Blob Storage that allows you to track and monitor access to your blobs. It provides detailed information about who 
accessed your blobs, when, and what actions were performed. This feature can help you identify and respond to security incidents or unauthorized access to your 
data more effectively (SIEM).

The following categories of Logs are available to export to Storage Account or EventHub. 

- Storage Read
- Storage Write
- Storage Delete
