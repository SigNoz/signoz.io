## Overview
The following categories of Container Apps Logs are available to export to Storage Account or EventHub. 

 - Container App console logs
 - Container App system logs
 - Spring App console logs

Although, the application logs could be sent directly in the Application Level using a OpenTelemetry Log Appender, this might not be an ideal solution for legacy software or micro-services model. It’s easier to do centralised logging for both application logs, system logs and SIEM Audit logs.
