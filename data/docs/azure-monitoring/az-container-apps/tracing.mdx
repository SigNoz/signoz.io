## Overview

Unified monitoring of your Azure Container App involves capturing application-level metrics and traces to provide comprehensive insights into your application's 
performance and resource utilization. For more detailed information on the unified monitoring in Azure, please refer to the [Azure Monitoring Strategy](../../bootstrapping/strategy).

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. An active Azure subscription with a running Azure Container App instance
2. [Central Collector Setup](../../bootstrapping/collector-setup)

## Setup

To get started with monitoring your Azure Container App, we recommend using OpenTelemetry (Otel) SDKs to instrument your application. These SDKs will allow you to 
collect and forward metrics and traces to a Central Collector.

### Installing the OpenTelemetry SDK

Please refer to our [SigNoz Tutorials](../../../instrumentation/) or [Blog](https://signoz.io/blog/) to find information on how to instrument your application like 
Spring, FastAPI, NextJS, Node.js, Flask, Django, etc. with OpenTelemetry.


```bash
# Node.js example
npm install @opentelemetry/api
npm install @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
npm install @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http
```

### Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK

```bash
# Set env vars or config file
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<Your-Central-Collector-DNS>:4318/"
```

For application-level traces and metrics, configure your application to use the DNS name of the [Central Collector](../../bootstrapping/collector-setup) you set up 
earlier. This Central Collector will automatically forward the collected data to SigNoz.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up monitoring for your Azure Container App, here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you resolve common problems:

1. **OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration**:
   - Verify that the OpenTelemetry Collector is running.
   - Ensure it is properly configured with the OLTP HTTP receiver.

2. **Azure Container App Accessibility**:
   - Confirm that your Azure Container App instance is up and accessible.

By following this guide, you should be able to monitor your Azure Container App's traces with SigNoz effectively, gaining valuable insights into your application's 
performance and resource utilization.
