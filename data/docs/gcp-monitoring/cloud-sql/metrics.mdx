## Overview

This document provides a detailed walkthrough on how to send Google Cloud SQL metrics to SigNoz. By the end of this guide, you will have a setup that sends your Cloud SQL metrics to SigNoz.

<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure Cloud SQL
* Create and configure Compute Engine VM instance to deploy OpenTelemetry Collector
* Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring
* Send and Visualize the metrics in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Cloud SQL Admin privilege.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Get started with Cloud SQL Configuration

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Cloud SQL](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-sql/cloud-sql-creation/) document to create Cloud SQL instance.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** Create `config.yaml`.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture for Cloud SQL, see the [available metrics for Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-cloudsql).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing Cloud Storage metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: my-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/usage_time"
      - metric_name: "cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/utilization"
      - metric_name: "cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/disk/bytes_used"
      - metric_name: "cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/disk/utilization"
      - metric_name: "cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/mysql/ddl_operations_count"
      - metric_name: "cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/mysql/dml_operations_count"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env,batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

After successful configuration start the OTel Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** While creating the panel, select metric for Cloud SQL.

All metrics starting with `cloudsql_googleapis_com_` have been collected from Cloud SQL.

For example, `cloudsql_googleapis_com_database_cpu_usage_time` is one of the metrics which is collected.

Here is the sample dashboard for Cloud SQL:

    />

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your Cloud SQL's metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.
