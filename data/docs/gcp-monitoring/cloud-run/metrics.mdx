**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure Cloud Run
* Deploy Telegraf to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud monitoring
* Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Telegraf
* Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Cloud Run Admin and Compute Engine Admin privileges.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Get started with Cloud Run service setup

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Cloud Run Service Setup](/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-run/cloud-run-setup) page to create Cloud Run Service.

## Deploy Telegraf to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

We will be using Compute Engine instance to install Telegraf. You can follow the instructions in the [Creating Copmute Engine](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation) document to create the Compute Engine instance. In this tutorial, we will be using the same instance for installing OTel Collector as well. You may choose a different instance as well.

**Step 1:** Install [`telegraf`](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) which will collect metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring for Cloud Run, see the [available metrics for Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-run). The installation process for the respective operating system can be found in official [documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1/install/).

After successful installation, the Telegraf status should be active and running. You can check the Telegraf status by running the command `service telegraf status`.

</figure>

The configuration file for telegraf can be found here:

```sh
/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
```

**Step 2:** Configure the Telegraf input and output plugin by adding configurations to the `telegraf.conf` file.

```txt
# Gather timeseries from Google Cloud Platform v3 monitoring API
[[inputs.stackdriver]]
  ## GCP Project
  project = "omni-new"
  ## Include timeseries that start with the given metric type.
  metric_type_prefix_include = [
    "run.googleapis.com",
  ]
  ## Most metrics are updated no more than once per minute; it is recommended
  ## to override the agent level interval with a value of 1m or greater.
  interval = "1m"
# Send OpenTelemetry metrics over gRPC
[[outputs.opentelemetry]]
  ## Override the default (localhost:4317) OpenTelemetry gRPC service
  ## address:port
  service_address = "localhost:4317"
```

The `service_address` is using `localhost` as we will be deploying OTelCollector in the same Compute Engine instance. You can replace it with the appropriate IP address in case you choose to deploy OTel Collector on a different instance.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Telegraf

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Telegraf. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

**Step 2:** After successful configuration start the OTel Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** Restart the Telegraf service using the command `service telegraf restart`.

**Step 4:** If the configurations are configured correctly with Telegraf and we can see the output logs from OpenTelemetry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard and select Time Series.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for Cloud Run metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:


* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of both Telegraf and the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz, OpenTelemetry, and Telegraf documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.

## Setup

### Get started with Cloud Run service setup

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Cloud Run Service Setup](/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-run/cloud-run-setup) page to create Cloud Run Service.

## Deploy Telegraf to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

You will need a Compute Engine instance to install Telegraf and OTel Collector. You can follow the instructions on the [Creating Compute Engine](/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation) document to create the Compute Engine instance.

**Step 1:** Install [`telegraf`](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) which will collect metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring for Cloud Run, see the [available metrics for Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-run). The installation process for the respective operating system can be found in official [documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1/install/).

After successful installation, the `telegraf` status should be active and running.

</figure>

The configuration file for telegraf can be found here:

```sh
/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
```

**Step 2:** Configure the Telegraf input and output plugin by adding configurations to the `telegraf.conf` file.

```txt
# Gather timeseries from Google Cloud Platform v3 monitoring API
[[inputs.stackdriver]]
  ## GCP Project
  project = "omni-new"
  ## Include timeseries that start with the given metric type.
  metric_type_prefix_include = [
    "run.googleapis.com",
  ]
  ## Most metrics are updated no more than once per minute; it is recommended
  ## to override the agent level interval with a value of 1m or greater.
  interval = "1m"
# Send OpenTelemetry metrics over gRPC
[[outputs.opentelemetry]]
  ## Override the default (localhost:4317) OpenTelemetry gRPC service
  ## address:port
  service_address = "localhost:4317"
```

We are assuming that the OTel Collector is running on the same machine as Telegraf. If that is not the case, you will have to change the `service_address` in the `outputs.opentelemetry` section accordingly.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Telegraf

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Telegraf. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

**Step 2:** After successful configuration start the OTel Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** Restart the Telegraf service

**Step 4:** If the configurations are configured correctly with Telegraf and we can see the output logs from OpenTelemetry as follows:
