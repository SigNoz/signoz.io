## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough to send the Google Compute Engine traces directly to SigNoz. By the end of this guide, you will have a setup that automatically sends your Compute Engine traces to SigNoz.

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>
**Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure Compute Engine
* Create an application on Compute Engine with tracing auto-intrumentation
* Send and Visualize the logs in SigNoz Cloud

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Compute Instance Admin privilege.
* [SigNoz Cloud Account](https://signoz.io/teams/) (we are using SigNoz Cloud for this demonstration, we will also need ingestion details. To get your **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** sign-in to your SigNoz Cloud Account and go to **Settings** >> **Ingestion Settings**)
* Access to a project in GCP

### Get started with Compute Engine Configuration

Create the Compute Engine instance using the following steps:

Step 1: Go to your GCP console and search for Compute Engine, go to **Compute Engine** service and click on **CREATE INSTANCE**.

        alt="Create Compute Engine Instance"
    />

Step 2: Give an apprpriate name for the Compute Engine instance. Select an appropriate region and zone. 
You can choose a machine as per your requirements. After choosing all the appropriate settings, click on **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page.

        alt="Compute Engine Instance Settings"
    />

With this, the Compute Engine instance is created.

### Create an application on Compute Engine

Please refer to our [SigNoz Tutorials](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) or [Blog](https://signoz.io/blog/) to find information on how to instrument your application like Spring, FastAPI, NextJS, Langchain, Node.js, Flask, Django, etc. with OpenTelemetry.

Here, we will be creating a NodeJS application. 

Step 1: Please refer to [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) document to install `Node.js` and `npm`.

Step 2: Once the NodeJS and npm are installed, create a folder with an appropriate NodeJS service name, and change directory to that folder.

```
mkdir my-nodejs-service
cd my-nodejs-service
```

Step 3: Create the npm application using `npm init`.

Step 4: Install OpenTelemetry packages and express dependency.

```
npm install --save @opentelemetry/api@^1.6.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-node@^0.45.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node@^0.39.4
npm install --save @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http@^0.45.0
npm install --save express
```

Step 5: Create `server.js` file

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Compute Engine!');
});

// Listen to the App Engine-specified port, or 8080 otherwise
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`);
});

```

This file contains the actual application logic. Here, we have created a very simple application that opens a GET endpoint at `/` which sends out a statement "Hello from Compute Engine!" in the response.

Step 6: Create `tracing.js` file

You need to configure the endpoint for SigNoz cloud in this file. You can find your ingestion key from SigNoz cloud account details sent on your email.

```
// tracing.js
'use strict'
const process = require('process')
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http')
const { Resource } = require('@opentelemetry/resources')
const { SemanticResourceAttributes } = require('@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions')

// do not set headers in exporterOptions, the OTel spec recommends setting headers through ENV variables
// https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#specifying-headers-via-environment-variables

// highlight-start
const exporterOptions = {
  url: 'https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces',
}
// highlight-end

const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter(exporterOptions)
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  resource: new Resource({
    // highlight-next-line
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: 'computeengine_nodejs_app',
  }),
})

// initialize the SDK and register with the OpenTelemetry API
// this enables the API to record telemetry
sdk.start()

// gracefully shut down the SDK on process exit
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log('Tracing terminated'))
    .catch((error) => console.log('Error terminating tracing', error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0))
})
```

In this example, we have used `computeengine_nodejs_app` as the service name. You can feel free to change it appropriately as per your use-case.

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US |	ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN |	ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |


Step 7: Run the NodeJS applicaiton using the following command:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>" node -r ./tracing.js app.js
```

`SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` is the API token provided by SigNoz. You can find your ingestion key from SigNoz cloud account details sent on your email.

The application is now up and running on port 8080.

### Open up the port on Compute Engine instance

In order to invoke the application, we need to open the port 8080 on the Compute Engine instance.

- On the GCP console, navigate to the Compute Engine page. Click on the instance where the NodeJS application is running.
- Scroll down to the `Network interfaces` section, and click on the network interface name.
- From the left side navigation menu, click on `Firewall`. On the Firewall Policies page, click on **CREATE FIREWALL RULE** button at the top.
- Put an appropraite name for the firewall rule, say `port-8080`, and an appropriate description.
- In the `Targets` dropdown, you can select `All instances in the network`, and in the `Source IPv4 ranges` textbox, put `0.0.0.0/0`. This will allow the incoming requests from any host.
- In the `Protocols and ports` section, tick the `TCP` checkbox, and mention the port `8080` in the textbox.
- Click on **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page.

With this, we have opened up incoming requests from any host to this VM instance at port 8080.

### Invoking the NodeJS application

On the Compute Engine page on the GCP console, copy the `External IP` of the instance where the NodeJS application is running.

Now, on a new tab in your browser, invoke the URL: `http://{external-ip-address}:8080/`. You should receive the response `Hello from Compute Engine!` on your browser.

Also, this would have resulted in a trace which should now start appearing in the SigNoz Cloud.

```
mkdir my-nodejs-service
cd my-nodejs-service
```

Step 3: Create the npm application using `npm init`.

```
npm install --save @opentelemetry/api@^1.6.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-node@^0.45.0

npm install --save @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http@^0.45.0
npm install --save express
```

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Compute Engine!');
});

// Listen to the App Engine-specified port, or 8080 otherwise
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`);
});

```

This file contains the actual application logic. Here, we have created a very simple application that opens a GET endpoint at `/` which sends out a statement "Hello from Compute Engine!" in the response.

Step 6: Create `tracing.js` file

You need to configure the endpoint for SigNoz cloud in this file. You can find your ingestion key from SigNoz cloud account details sent on your email.

```
// tracing.js
'use strict'
const process = require('process')
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node')
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node')
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http')
const { Resource } = require('@opentelemetry/resources')
const { SemanticResourceAttributes } = require('@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions')

// do not set headers in exporterOptions, the OTel spec recommends setting headers through ENV variables
// https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#specifying-headers-via-environment-variables

// highlight-start
const exporterOptions = {
  url: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces',
}
// highlight-end

const traceExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter(exporterOptions)
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter,
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  resource: new Resource({
    // highlight-next-line
    [SemanticResourceAttributes.SERVICE_NAME]: 'computeengine_nodejs_app',
  }),
})

// initialize the SDK and register with the OpenTelemetry API
// this enables the API to record telemetry
sdk.start()

// gracefully shut down the SDK on process exit
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  sdk
    .shutdown()
    .then(() => console.log('Tracing terminated'))
    .catch((error) => console.log('Error terminating tracing', error))
    .finally(() => process.exit(0))
})
```

In this example, we have used `computeengine_nodejs_app` as the service name. You can feel free to change it appropriately as per your use-case.

`http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` is the default url for sending your tracing data. We are assuming you have installed SigNoz on your `localhost`. Based on your environment, you can update it accordingly. It should be in the following format:

```
http://<IP of SigNoz backend>:4318/v1/traces
```

Step 7: Run the NodeJS applicaiton using the following command:

```
node -r ./tracing.js app.js
```

The application is now up and running on port 8080.

### Open up the port on Compute Engine instance

In order to invoke the application, we need to open the port 8080 on the Compute Engine instance.

- On the GCP console, navigate to the Compute Engine page. Click on the instance where the NodeJS application is running.
- Scroll down to the `Network interfaces` section, and click on the network interface name.
- From the left side navigation menu, click on `Firewall`. On the Firewall Policies page, click on **CREATE FIREWALL RULE** button at the top.
- Put an appropraite name for the firewall rule, say `port-8080`, and an appropriate description.
- In the `Targets` dropdown, you can select `All instances in the network`, and in the `Source IPv4 ranges` textbox, put `0.0.0.0/0`. This will allow the incoming requests from any host.
- In the `Protocols and ports` section, tick the `TCP` checkbox, and mention the port `8080` in the textbox.
- Click on **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page.

With this, we have opened up incoming requests from any host to this VM instance at port 8080.

### Invoking the NodeJS application

On the Compute Engine page on the GCP console, copy the `External IP` of the instance where the NodeJS application is running.

Now, on a new tab in your browser, invoke the URL: `http://{external-ip-address}:8080/`. You should receive the response `Hello from Compute Engine!` on your browser.

Also, this would have resulted in a trace which should now start appearing in SigNoz.
