<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

{/* **Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure App Engine service to generate the metrics
* Invoke the App Engine service
* Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring
* Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz Cloud */}

## Prerequisites

* A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privileges or App Engine Admin privileges
* Access to a project in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* [Cloud Build API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com) is enabled

## Setup

### Get started with App Engine Configuration

Create the App Engine service using the following steps:

Step 1: [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) the Google Cloud CLI.

Step 2: To [initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) the gcloud CLI, run the following command:

```
gcloud init
```

Step 3: Run the following `gcloud` command to enable App Engine and create the associated application resources. Note that the [location](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app/creating-gcp-project#creating_a_gcp_project) you select cannot be changed later.

```
gcloud app create
```

Step 4: In this example, we will be building the Python 3 application. For this,

1. Download the sample application repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/):

```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
```

Alternatively, you can [download the sample](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/archive/master.zip) as a zip file and then extract it.

2. Navigate to the directory that contains a copy of the files from the previous step:

```
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
```

Note that we have `app.yaml` file located in this folder.

3. When on this folder which contains `app.yaml`, you can deploy your service using the command:

```
gcloud app deploy
```

4. On running the above command, the service will get deployed on the App Engine, and you will get the logs containing the endpoint which can be used to trigger the deployed service (highlighted in red in the screenshot).

Open the URL in the new browser which will invoke the App Engine service.

## Deploy OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** Create `config.yaml`.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture for App Engine, see the [available metrics for App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-appengine).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing App Engine metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: my-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/cpu/utilization"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/network/received_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/network/sent_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/nginx/connections/current"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

After successful configuration start the OTel Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/app-engine/metrics/otel-logs.webp"
        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />

</figure>

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** While creating the panel, select metric for App Engine.

All metrics starting with `appengine_googleapis_com_` have been collected from App Engine.

Here is the sample dashboard for App Engine:

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your App Engine's metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of both App Engine and the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.

## Deploying a Self-Hosted SigNoz in a Docker container

**Step 1:** The deployment process of the Self-Hosted `SigNoz` can be found in official [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/).

**Step 2:** Make sure all the containers are running in a **Healthy** state.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/app-engine/signoz-self-host-docker-ps.webp"
        alt="SigNoz Self-Hosted using Docker"
    />

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="self-hosted-otel" label="Directly send to self-hosted SigNoz">

The self-hosted SigNoz setup also includes the OTel collector in the bundle. Docker will deploy the OTel collector beside SigNoz as a container. The same OTel collector can be used to directly receive any signals, otherwise, if one more OTel Collector is required for a more granular collection, we can add an additional independent OTel collector, see Using Central OTel collector in between tab.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="addon-otel" label="Using central OTel collector in between">

Apart from using the native OTel collector present in the docker from the previous method, we can also deploy an additional independent OTel collector which can act as an additional collector in this setup for more granular metrics collection.

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry to scrape the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring. Add the following code block to the OpenTelemetry configuration file. Under exporters, we should have an exporter pointing to our SigNoz self-host setup. For example, in the below snippet, the endpoint-ip would be the address of the VM in which the SigNoz self-host setup is present.

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
	endpoint: "<endpoint-ip>:4317"
	tls:
  	   insecure: true
  logging:
	verbosity: normal
```
<Admonition type="info">
We can use the default receiver configurations for OTel.
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
```
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** After successful configuration, start the OTel service.

<Admonition type="note">
Please make appropriate changes to the networking connections (adding network to security groups, opening ports, etc.) on your VMs as per your setup.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Configuring config.yaml

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing App Engine metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: my-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/cpu/utilization"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/network/received_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/network/sent_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/flex/instance/nginx/connections/current"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count"
      - metric_name: "appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "<IP of machine hosting SigNoz>:4317"
    tls:
      insecure: true
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture for App Engine, see the [available metrics for App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-appengine).

If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

## Visualize the metrics in Self-Hosted SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to your Self-Hosted SigNoz UI, and navigate to the Self-Hosted SigNoz dashboard. Click on the **Dashboards** section to view the metrics. Create a new dashboard (If not already present ). The default Self-Hosted SigNoz dashboard endpoint would be `http://<Self-Hosted SigNoz-host-ip>:3301`, however, the URL can be different based on how you have set up the infrastructure.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** While creating the panel, select metric for App Engine.

All metrics starting with `appengine_googleapis_com_` have been collected from App Engine.

Here is the sample dashboard for App Engine:

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your App Engine's metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Verify Docker container logs:** Check if all the containers are running properly, and not unexpectedly crashed.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of both App Engine and the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.
