## Setup

### Get started with Cloud Storage Audit Log Configuration

Enable the Google Cloud Storage Audit Logs using the following steps:

Step 1: Go to your GCP console and search for Audit Logs, go to **Audit Logs** under IAM and Admin service.

Step 3: You can select the Google Cloud Storage record by clicking on the check box to the left of the record. This will popup the permission settings to the right of the screen.

Check the **Data Write** option, and click **SAVE** button. This will enable the data write audit logs on the Google Cloud Storage service.

<Admonition type="info">
You can choose to select **Admin Read** and **Date Read** options as well from the Permission Types popup. But note that choosing those options can lead to huge number of audit logs, eventually even increasing the cost.

### Create PubSub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation/) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup/) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Compute Engine logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="gcs_bucket"
```

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create another Compute Engine instance. We will be installing OTel Collector on this instance.

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. Replace `<region>` with the appropriate SigNoz Cloud region. Replace `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` with what is provided by SigNoz:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SigNoz-Key>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

### Invoking Cloud Storage logs

Step 1: On the GCP console, search for Cloud Storage, go to **Cloud Storage** service.

Step 2: Click on the **CREATE** button at the top of the Cloud Storage page to create a bucket.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/gcs/logging/create-gcs-bucket.webp"
        alt="Create Cloud Storage Bucket"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Step 3: On the **Create a Bucket** page, provide an appropriate name for the bucket in the **Name your bucket** section, and click on **CONTINUE**.

In the **Choose where to store your data section**, choose an appropriate location type, and click on **CONTINUE**. You can select an appropriate option in the rest of the sections as per your requirements, or let them be as default.

After filling the complete form, click on the **CREATE** button at the bottom of the page. This will create the new bucket.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/gcs/logging/name-gcs-bucket.webp"
        alt="Name the Cloud Storage Bucket"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>
Name the Cloud Storage Bucket
</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Step 4: Optionally, you can also upload files to the newly created bucket. For that, click on the **UPLOAD FILES** button, and select the file you want to upload.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/gcs/logging/upload-to-gcs-bucket.webp"
        alt="Upload File to Cloud Storage Bucket"
    />

### Create PubSub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation/) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup/) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Compute Engine logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="gcs_bucket"
```

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance. 

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. We are using the `clickhouselogsexporter` in this case.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  clickhouselogsexporter:
    dsn: tcp://clickhouse:9000/
    timeout: 5s
    sending_queue:
      queue_size: 100
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 300s
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

### Invoking Cloud Storage logs

Step 1: On the GCP console, search for Cloud Storage, go to **Cloud Storage** service.

Step 2: Click on the **CREATE** button at the top of the Cloud Storage page to create a bucket.
