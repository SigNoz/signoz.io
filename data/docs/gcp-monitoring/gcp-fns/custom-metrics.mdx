## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough on how to set up a Google Cloud Function to send the custom metrics to SigNoz. 

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

{/* **Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide**

* Create and configure a Cloud Function
* Invoke the Cloud Function
* Send and Visualize the custom metrics in SigNoz */}

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Cloud Functions Admin privilege.
* Access to a project in GCP
* Google Cloud Functions APIs enabled (follow [this](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841?hl=en) guide to see how to enable an API in Google Cloud)

## Setup

### Get started with Cloud Function Configuration

Follow these steps to create the Cloud Function:

 **Step 1:** Go to your GCP console, search for Cloud Functions, go to Functions, and click on **CREATE FUNCTION**.

        alt="Create Cloud Function"
    />
<figcaption>

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

**Step 2:** Fill in the following details to create a Cloud Function:

1. Environment: 2nd gen
2. Function name: Name for the Cloud Function
3. Region: Takes the default region of the GCP account
4. Trigger: Defines how to trigger the Cloud Function
    1. Trigger Type: HTTPS - this allows us to trigger the Cloud Function using a URL
    2. Authentication: Choose whether you need authenticated or unauthenticated invocations. We have chosen an unauthenticated invocation for this demonstration.

        alt="Configure Cloud Function"
    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

**Step 3:** Expand the **Runtime, build, connections, and security settings** section, and under **Runtime environment variables:**

Add ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`` and ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` with **Ingestion Key** and **Ingestion URL,** respectively.

### Add code to the Google Cloud Function

For this demonstration, we will be using Python 3.12

Below is the comprehensive code of the `main.py` file, followed by a high-level overview of what the code is doing.

```python
import os
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.metric_exporter import OTLPMetricExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import PeriodicExportingMetricReader
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from random import randint
# Initialize the OpenTelemetry meter provider with OTLP exporter
exporter = OTLPMetricExporter()

# Set up the resource with service name
resource = Resource(attributes={
   SERVICE_NAME: os.environ.get("K_SERVICE")
})

# Set up the meter provider and reader
metric_reader = PeriodicExportingMetricReader(exporter, export_interval_millis=5000)
provider = MeterProvider(resource=resource, metric_readers=[metric_reader])
metrics.set_meter_provider(provider)

# Create a meter
meter = metrics.get_meter(__name__)

# Create a counter metric
request_counter = meter.create_counter(
   name="requests",
   description="Number of requests",
   unit="1"
)

random_counter = meter.create_up_down_counter(
   name="random_count",
   description="some random number between 50 and 100",
   unit="1"

)

def send_metrics(request):
   """
   Google Cloud Function to send metrics to SigNoz.
   """
   # Simulate a metric update (e.g., increment the counter)
   request_counter.add(1, {"environment": "production"})
   random_counter.add(randint(50,100))
   return "Metrics sent!", 200

# Ensure the exporter flushes before the function terminates
def finalize():
   metric_reader.shutdown()
   exporter.shutdown()

   print("shutdown!")

import atexit
atexit.register(finalize)
```

Below is a high-level overview of the above code snippet:

* **Service Name:** Configures the OpenTelemetry resource with the service name from the environment variable K_SERVICE.
* **Metric Exporting:** Sends metrics to SigNoz using OTLP with a 5-second export interval.
* **Counter Metrics:** Tracks the number of requests with a counter and generates random numbers between 50 and 100 with an up-down counter.
* **Metric Updates:** Simulates metric updates each time the send_metrics function is called.
* **Graceful Shutdown:** Cleans up and flushes metrics data before the application exits to ensure all data is sent.

To install the required packages, add a **requirements.txt** file to the source with the following content: 

```txt
functions-framework==3.*
opentelemetry-sdk
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
```

The requirements.txt file should contain all the packages that your Cloud Function depends upon. Google Cloud Function uses this file to create an environment with all the required packages.

Once you’ve finished writing your code, locate the **DEPLOY** button. After clicking the **DEPLOY** button, Google Cloud Function initiates deployment, starts provisioning the function according to the specified configuration, initializes the environment, handles dependencies, and makes the function ready to handle incoming requests.

## Testing your cloud function

**Step 1:** After completing the deployment, navigate to the **TRIGGER** section to obtain the URL to invoke the function.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">

        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/custom-metrics/cloud-function-link.webp"
        alt="Deploying Function"
    />
<figcaption>

**Step 2:** Hit the URL that you have obtained, and you will see the function output.

        alt="Cloud Function URL"
    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

**Step 3:** Click on the **logs** section in your Cloud Function to view the logs, indicating that the custom metrics have been sent to SigNoz successfully.

## Visualize the custom metrics in SigNoz Cloud

1. Log in to your SigNoz cloud account.
2. Navigate to the Dashboards, and add a dashboard
3. Add a Timeseries Panel
4. In Metrics, select random_count and _AVG By _selecting tag location
5. In Filter say name = mention service name (EX. K_SERVICE)
6. Hit “Save Changes” You now have the random count of your Cloud Function in a Dashboard for reporting and alerting

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/custom-metrics/signoz-dashboard.webp"
        alt="Creating new panel in SigNoz Dashboard"
    />
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>

That's it! You have successfully set up monitoring for your Cloud Function's custom metrics with SigNoz Cloud.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Function's custom metrics with SigNoz, here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

* Verify that your Cloud Function instance is running and accessible.
* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the custom metrics in your function.
* If you are using a SigNoz Cloud Account, check and mention the correct URL of the SigNoz Cloud account and the Ingestion(token) key.

By following this guide. You can easily send the custom metrics of your Google Cloud Funtion to SigNoz and gain valuable insights in case there is an issue.
