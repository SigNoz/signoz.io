Step 2: Fill in the following details to create a Cloud Function:

1. Environment: 2nd gen
2. Function name: Name for the Cloud Function
3. Region: Takes the default region of the GCP account
4. Trigger: Defines how to trigger the Cloud Function
    1. Trigger Type: HTTPS - this allows us to trigger the Cloud Function using a URL
    2. Authentication: Choose whether you need authenticated or unauthenticated invocations. We have chosen unauthenticated invocation for this demonstration.

### Add code to the Google Cloud Function

Below is the comprehensive code of the `main.py` file, followed by a high level overview of what the code is doing.

```python
import functions_framework

@functions_framework.http
def hello_http(request):

    print("Initializing Function...")

    request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
    request_args = request.args

    if request_json and 'name' in request_json:
        name = request_json['name']
        print("name is in request_json")

    elif request_args and 'name' in request_args:
        name = request_args['name']
        print("name is in request_args")

    else:
        print("No name found.")
        name = 'World'

    print("Sending response...")

    return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
```

Below is a high-level overview of the above code snippet:

* **hello_http(request)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, extracts 'name' from the request, and logs various stages of execution.
* **@funtions_framework.http**: Decorator that defines `hello_http` as an HTTP handler for Google Cloud Functions.
* The code print out different messages for log entries and returns a greeting message.

There are no changes to requirements.txt file.

Once you’ve finished writing your code, locate the **DEPLOY** button. After clicking the **DEPLOY** button, Google Cloud Function initiates deployment, starts provisioning the function according to the specified configuration, initializes the environment, handles dependencies, and makes the function ready to handle incoming requests.

### Create Pub/Sub topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation/) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Setup Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup/) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Cloud Function logs, use the following filter conditions:

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
```

In case you want the logs only from a particular Cloud Function, you can add the following filter conditions in the `Query` text box:

```
resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
resource.labels.service_name="<function-name>"
```

<figure data-zoomable align="left">

### Setup OTel Collector

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance. 

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. Replace `<region>` with the appropriate SigNoz Cloud region. Replace `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` with what is provided by SigNoz:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SigNoz-Key>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

You can now trigger the Cloud Function a few times, and see the logs from the GCP Cloud Functions on SigNoz.

### Add code to the Google Cloud Function

For this demonstration, we will be using Python 3.10.

Below is the comprehensive code of the `main.py` file, followed by a high level overview of what the code is doing.

```python
import functions_framework
from os import environ
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime
import random
from time import sleep

def write_log(log_data, trace_id):

    sleep(1)

    print("Sending the log to SigNoz...")
    print(f"log_data: {log_data}")

    req_headers = {

         'signoz-ingestion-key': environ.get('SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY'),
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'

    }

    data = [{

      "timestamp": int(datetime.now().timestamp()),
      "trace_id": f"{trace_id}",
      "severity_text": "info",
      "severity_number": 5,
      "resources": {

        "resource-type": "gcloud-function",
        "resource-name": "function-3",
        "resource-region": "asia-south-1"

      },

      "body": log_data,

    }]

    # Specify the HTTP endpoint for sending the data

    http_url = environ.get('SIGNOZ_HTTP_URL')
    response = requests.post(http_url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=req_headers)

    if not response.status_code == 200:

        print("Failed to send the log to SigNoz.")
        print(response.text)

    else:
        print("Sent the log to SigNoz successfully.")

@functions_framework.http

def hello_http(request):

    epoch_string = f"{int(datetime.now().timestamp())}"

    if len(epoch_string)%2 == 0:
        random_hex_string = ''.join(random.choices('0123456789abcdef', k=8))

    else:
        random_hex_string = ''.join(random.choices('0123456789abcdef', k=7))

    trace_id = f"{epoch_string}{random_hex_string}"

    write_log("Initializing Function...", trace_id)


    request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
    request_args = request.args

    if request_json and 'name' in request_json:
        name = request_json['name']
        write_log("name is in request_json", trace_id)

    elif request_args and 'name' in request_args:
        name = request_args['name']
        write_log("name is in request_args", trace_id)

    else:
        write_log("No name found.", trace_id)
        name = 'World'

    write_log("Sending response...", trace_id)

    return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
```

Below is a high-level overview of the above code snippet:



* **hello_http(request)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, extracts 'name' from the request, and logs various stages of execution.
* **@funtions_framework.http**: Decorator that defines `hello_http` as an HTTP handler for Google Cloud Functions.
* **write_log(log_data, trace_id)**: Sends log data to SigNoz using an HTTP POST request with appropriate headers and log structure.
* The code creates an even length string consisting of the current timestamp followed by a hex string at the beginning and uses it as a unique `trace_id` for log entries and returns a greeting message.

To install the required packages, add a requirements.txt file to the source with the following content: 

```txt
functions-framework==3.*
requests

```

The requirements.txt file should contain all the external Python libraries and packages that your Cloud Function depends upon. This file is used by Google Cloud Function to create an environment with all the required packages.

Once you’ve finished writing your code, locate the **DEPLOY** button. After clicking the **DEPLOY** button, Google Cloud Function initiates deployment, starts provisioning the function according to the specified configuration, initializes the environment, handles dependencies, and makes the function ready to handle incoming requests.


## Test your Cloud Function

Step 1: After completing the deployment, navigate to the **TRIGGER** section to obtain the URL to invoke the function.

</figure>


## Visualize the logs in SigNoz Cloud

Go to your SigNoz UI, and navigate to the SigNoz dashboard. Click on the **Logs** section to view the logs.


**Note**: If you have multiple applications already sending logs to SigNoz, you can check by adding `resource-type`, `resource-name`, and `resource-region` filters in the Search filters field. Put the values that we used in the payload in the `write_log` function of our Cloud Function.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

That's it! You have successfully set up monitoring for your Cloud Function's logs with SigNoz Cloud.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Function's logs with SigNoz, here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

* Verify that your Cloud Function instance is running and accessible.
* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the logs in your function.
* Check and mention the correct URL of the SigNoz Cloud account and the Ingestion(token) key.

By following this guide, you should be able to easily send the logs of your Google Cloud Function's system to SigNoz and gain valuable insights in case there is some issue.

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands. These commands need to be run on the same host where you would be running the OTel Collector agent.

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

Step 1: Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.88.0/otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.88.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

Step 3: Create `config.yaml` in the folder `otelcol-contrib` with the below content in it. We are using the `clickhouselogsexporter` in this case.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/<pubsub-topic's-subscription>
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  clickhouselogsexporter:
    dsn: tcp://clickhouse:9000/
    timeout: 5s
    sending_queue:
      queue_size: 100
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 300s
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

Step 4: Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service with the following command:

From the otelcol-contrib, run the following command:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml
```

**Run in background**

If you want to run OTel Collector process in the background:

```bash
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

The above command sends the output of the otel-collector to `otelcol-output.log` file and prints the process id of the background running OTel Collector process to the `otel-pid` file.

If you want to see the output of the logs you’ve just set up for the background process, you may look it up with:

```bash
tail -f -n 50 otelcol-output.log
```

You can now trigger the Cloud Function a few times, and see the logs from the GCP Cloud Functions on SigNoz.

## Setup

### Get started with Cloud Function Configuration

Follow these steps to create the Cloud Function:

Step 1: Go to your GCP console and search for Cloud Functions, go to Functions and click on **CREATE FUNCTION**.


<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/self-hosted-logs/cloud-function.webp"
        alt="GCP Cloud Functions"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>
GCP Cloud Functions
</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>


Step 2: Fill in the following details to create a Cloud Function:

1. Environment: 2nd gen
2. Function name: Name for the Cloud Function
3. Region: Takes the default region of the GCP account
4. Trigger: Defines how to trigger the Cloud Function
    1. Trigger Type: HTTPS - this allows us to trigger the Cloud Function using a URL
    2. Authentication: Choose whether you need authenticated or unauthenticated invocations. We have chosen unauthenticated invocation for this demonstration.

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Step 3: Expand the **Runtime, build, connections, and security settings** section, and under **Runtime environment variables:**

ADD `Self-Hosted SIGNOZ_HTTP_URL` The SigNoz endpoint would be `http://<Self-Hosted SigNoz-host-ip>:8082` however, the URL can differ based on how you set up the infrastructure.

        alt="Runtime and Entry Point of Cloud Function"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</figcaption>
</figure>

### Add code to the Google Cloud Function

For this demonstration, we will be using Python 3.10.

Below is the comprehensive code of the `main.py` file, followed by a high level overview of what the code is doing.


```python
import functions_framework
from os import environ
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime
import random

def write_log(log_data, trace_id):
   print("Sending the log to SigNoz...")
   print(f"log_data: {log_data}")

   req_headers = {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
   }

   data = [{
       "timestamp": int(datetime.now().timestamp()),
       "trace_id": f"{trace_id}",
       "severity_text": "info",
       "severity_number": 5,
       "resources": {
           "resource-type": "gcloud-function",
           "resource-name": "function-3",
           "resource-region": "asia-south-1"
       },
       "body": log_data,
   }]


   # Specify the HTTP endpoint for sending the data
   http_url = environ.get('SIGNOZ_HTTP_URL')
   print(f"HTTP URL: {http_url}")  # Debug statement to verify the URL


   response = requests.post(http_url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=req_headers)

   if response.status_code != 200:
       print("Failed to send the log to SigNoz.")
       print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
       print(response.text)
   else:
       print("Sent the log to SigNoz successfully.")

@functions_framework.http
def hello_http(request):
   epoch_string = f"{int(datetime.now().timestamp())}"
   if len(epoch_string) % 2 == 0:
       random_hex_string = ''.join(random.choices('0123456789abcdef', k=8))
   else:
       random_hex_string = ''.join(random.choices('0123456789abcdef', k=7))
   trace_id = f"{epoch_string}{random_hex_string}"
   write_log("Initializing Function...", trace_id)


   request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
   request_args = request.args

   if request_json and 'name' in request_json:
       name = request_json['name']
       write_log("name is in request_json", trace_id)
   elif request_args and 'name' in request_args:
       name = request_args['name']
       write_log("name is in request_args", trace_id)
   else:
       write_log("No name found.", trace_id)
       name = 'World'


   write_log("Sending response...", trace_id)
   return 'Hello {}!'.format(name)
```

Below is a high-level overview of the above code snippet:

* **hello_http(request)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, extracts 'name' from the request, and logs various stages of execution.
* **@funtions_framework.http**: Decorator that defines `hello_http` as an HTTP handler for Google Cloud Functions.
* **write_log(log_data, trace_id)**: Sends log data to Self-Hosted SigNoz using an HTTP POST request with appropriate headers and log structure.
* The code creates an even length string consisting of the current timestamp followed by a hex string at the beginning and uses it as a unique `trace_id` for log entries and returns a greeting message.

To install the required packages, add a requirements.txt file to the source with the following content: 

```txt
functions-framework==3.*
requests
```

The requirements.txt file should contain all the external Python libraries and packages that your Cloud Function depends upon. This file is used by Google Cloud Function to create an environment with all the required packages.

Once you've finished writing your code, locate the **DEPLOY** button. After clicking the **DEPLOY** button, Google Cloud Function initiates deployment, starts provisioning the function according to the specified configuration, initializes the environment, handles dependencies, and makes the function ready to handle incoming requests.


## Test your Cloud Function

Step 1: After completing the deployment, navigate to the **TRIGGER** section to obtain the URL to invoke the function.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/self-hosted-logs/deploying-function.webp"
        alt="Deploying Function"
    />
<figcaption>

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Step 2: Hit the URL that you have obtained, you will see the function output.

        alt="Cloud Function URL"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/self-hosted-logs/function-logs.webp"
        alt="Cloud Function Logs"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

## Visualize the logs in Self-Hosted SigNoz

Go to your Self-Hosted SigNoz UI, and navigate to the Self-Hosted SigNoz dashboard. Click on the **Logs** section to view the logs. The default Self-Hosted SigNoz dashboard endpoint would be `http://<Self-Hosted SigNoz-host-ip>:3301`.

**Note**: If you have multiple applications already sending logs to Self-Hosted SigNoz, you can check by adding `resource-type`, `resource-name`, and `resource-region` filters in the Search filters field. Put the values that we used in the payload in the `write_log` function of our Cloud Function.

That's it! You have successfully set up monitoring for your Cloud Function's logs with Self-Hosted SigNoz.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Function's logs with Self-Hosted SigNoz, here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

* Verify that your Cloud Function instance is running and accessible.
* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the logs in your function.
* Check and mention the correct URL of the Self-Hosted SigNoz Self-Host, OTel configuration, and routing.

By following this guide, you should be able to easily send the logs of your Google Cloud Function's system to Self-Hosted SigNoz and gain valuable insights in case there is some issue.
