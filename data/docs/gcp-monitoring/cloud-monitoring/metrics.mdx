## Overview

Google Cloud Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. It collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud, hosted uptime probes, and application instrumentation.

This document provides a detailed walkthrough on how to send Google Cloud Monitoring metrics to SigNoz.

* Create uptime check for Cloud Run service
* Create and configure Compute Engine VM instance to deploy OpenTelemetry Collector
* Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring
* Send and Visualize the metrics in SigNoz Cloud */}

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or Monitoring Admin and Compute Engine Admin privilege
* Cloud Run Admin and Artifact Registry Admin in case you want to setup Cloud Run service to create an uptime check
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Create Uptime Check for Cloud Run service

In case you want to create a Cloud Run service, follow the [Cloud Run Service Setup](/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-run/cloud-run-setup) document for detailed steps.

To setup uptime check on the Cloud Run service:

Step 1: On the GCP console, search for "Uptime checks", and naviagte to `Uptime checks` under the Monitoring service from the dropdown.

Step 2: On the `Uptime checks` page, click on **Create uptime check** button at the top.

        alt="Click on Create uptime check button"
    />

</figure>

Step 3: Select the **Protocol** as `HTTPS`, **Resource type** as `Cloud Run Service`. From the `Cloud Run Service` dropdown that appears, choose the appropriate service. 
In the **Path** provide `/`. **Frequency** can be adjusted as per your requirement. In this case, we will go with the default `1 minute`. Click on `Continue`.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img

        alt="Create uptime check - Select Resource"
    />

Step 4: No changes are required on this page. Click on `Continue`.

    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/create-uptime-check-response-codes.webp"
        alt="Create uptime check - Response Codes"
    />
<figcaption>

</figure>

Step 5: In this example, we won't set any alert. Hence, toggle off the **Create an alert** option, and click on `Continue`.

    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/create-uptime-check-alert-creation.webp"
        alt="Create uptime check - Alert Creation"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</i>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Step 6: Give an appropriate title to the uptime check. Click on `Test`. The uptime check should be successful with 200 response.
Once tested, you can create the uptime check.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/create-uptime-check-test.webp"
        alt="Test the uptime check"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</figcaption>
</figure>

The uptime check is created, and from here on, the metrics will start getting emitted for Cloud Run service's uptime check.

### Deploy OpenTelemetry to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

You will need a Compute Engine instance to install OpenTelemetry Collector. You can follow the instructions on the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance.

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** Create `config.yaml`.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture from Cloud Monitoring, see the [available metrics for Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-monitoring).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing Cloud Monitoring metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: gcp-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/check_passed"
      - metric_name: "monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/content_mismatch"
      - metric_name: "monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/error_code"
      - metric_name: "monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/http_status"
      - metric_name: "monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/request_latency"
      - metric_name: "monitoring.googleapis.com/uptime_check/time_until_ssl_cert_expires"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env,batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

After successful configuration start the OpenTelemetry Collector using the following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

<figure data-zoomable align="left">

        src="/img/docs/gcp-monitoring/cloud-monitoring/metrics/otel-logs.webp"
        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />
<figcaption>
<i>

</figcaption>
</figure>

## Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** Select metric for Cloud Monitoring

All metrics starting with `mointoring_googleapis_com_` have been collected from Cloud Monitoring.

For example `monitoring_googleapis_com_uptime_check_request_latency` is one of the metrics that was collected.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Monitoring's metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.
