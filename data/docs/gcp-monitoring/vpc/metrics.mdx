* Create Serverless VPC Access Connector

## Prerequisites

* [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege, or Serverless VPC Access Admin and Compute Engine Admin privilege. You might also require access to create Cloud Function in case you are following the tutorial to create Serverless VPC Connector.
* Access to a project in GCP

## Setup

### Create Serverless VPC Access Connector

Follow the [Creating Serverless VPC Access Connector](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/vpc/vpc-connector-creation/) document to create the serverless VPC access connector.

### Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector to fetch the metrics from Google Cloud Monitoring

You will need a Compute Engine instance to install OpenTelemetry Collector. You can follow the instructions on the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance.

**Step 1:** Install and configure OpenTelemetry for scraping the metrics from GCP Serverless VPC Access Connector. Follow [OpenTelemetry Binary Usage in Virtual Machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) guide for detailed instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Note that `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver is supported only from version 0.112.0 and above of opentelemetry-collector. So, ensure you download and use the appropriate release.
</Admonition>

**Step 2:** Create `config.yaml`.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture from Serverless VPC Access Connector, see the [available metrics for Serverless VPC Access Connector](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-vpcaccess).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing Serverless VPC Access Connector metrics:

```
receivers:
  googlecloudmonitoring:
    collection_interval: 5m # Can be specified in seconds (s), minutes (m), or hours (h)
    project_id: gcp-project-id
    metrics_list:
      - metric_name: "vpcaccess.googleapis.com/connector/cpu/utilizations"
      - metric_name: "vpcaccess.googleapis.com/connector/instances"
      - metric_name: "vpcaccess.googleapis.com/connector/received_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "vpcaccess.googleapis.com/connector/received_packets_count"
      - metric_name: "vpcaccess.googleapis.com/connector/sent_bytes_count"
      - metric_name: "vpcaccess.googleapis.com/connector/sent_packets_count"
processors:
  resource/env:
    attributes:
    - key: deployment.environment
      value: prod
      action: upsert
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [googlecloudmonitoring]
      processors: [resource/env,batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

| Region	| Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

After successful configuration start the OpenTelemetry Collector using following command:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

**Step 3:** If the configurations are configured correctly, you can see the output logs from OpenTelemtry as follows:

        alt="OTel Collector Logs"
    />

### Send and Visualize the metrics obtained by OpenTelemetry in SigNoz

**Step 1:** Go to the SigNoz Cloud URL and head over to the dashboard.

**Step 2:** If not already created, create a new dashboard. You can create the dashboard and multiple panel under it by following the instructions [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/).

**Step 3:** Select metric for Serverless VPC Access Connector

All metrics starting with `vpcaccess_googleapis_com_` have been collected from Serverless VPC Access Connector.

For example `vpcaccess_googleapis_com_connector_instances` is one of the metrics that was collected.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems while setting up monitoring for your Serverless VPC Access Connector metrics with SigNoz, consider these troubleshooting steps:

* **Verify Configuration**: Double-check your `config.yaml` file to ensure all settings, including the ingestion key and endpoint, are correct.
* **Review Logs**: Look at the logs of the OpenTelemetry Collector to identify any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what’s going wrong.
* **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all relevant packages and dependencies are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
* **Consult Documentation**: Review the SigNoz and OpenTelemetry documentation for any additional troubleshooting of the common issues.

Under the `googlecloudmonitoring` receiver, you need to specify the metrics that you want to capture in the `metrics_list`. You can include all the metrics that you would like to capture from Serverless VPC Access Connector, see the [available metrics for Serverless VPC Access Connector](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-vpcaccess).

Here is the `config.yaml` file for capturing Serverless VPC Access Connector metrics:

```
