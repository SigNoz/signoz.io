## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed walkthrough on how to set up a Pub/Sub to collect Cloud Load Balancer (CLB) logs and forward them to SigNoz. 

{/* Here's a quick summary of what we will be doing in this guide      

* Create a Pub/Sub topic.
* Create a Log Router to route the Cloud Load Balancer logs to SigNoz.
* Create OTel Collector to route logs from Pub/Sub topic to SigNoz.
* Send and Visualize the logs in SigNoz. */}

<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

## Prerequisites

1. [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with administrative privilege or load balancer Admin privilege.
2. Cloud Load Balancer (logging should be enabled)
3. Access to a project in GCP
4. [Google Cloud Monitoring API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/monitoring.googleapis.com) enabled

## Setup

### Create a Pub/Sub topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Pub/Sub Topic](https://signoz.iohttps://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/pubsub-topic-creation//) document to create the Pub/Sub topic.

### Create Log Router to Pub/Sub Topic

Follow the steps mentioned in the [Log Router Setup](https://signoz.iohttps://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/log-router-setup//) document to create the Log Router.

To ensure you filter out only the Load Balancer logs, use the following filter conditions:

```sh
resource.type="Application Load Balancer"
```

In case you want the logs only from a particular Load Balancer, you can add the following query to the Query text box:

```sh
resource.type="load balancer"
resource.labels.service_name="<FORWARDING RULE NAME>"
```

### Provide permissions to Log Router Sink

* On the GCP console, search for _Log Router_, and navigate to Logs Router in the GCP Logging service.
* Click on the 3 dots to the right of the Log Router sink that we created in the earlier steps, and select_ View sink details_ from the dropdown.

* In order to provide the Log Router sink with the permissions to write to the Pub/Sub topic, navigate to the Pub/Sub service, and click on the 3 dots to the right of the Pub/Sub topic where the router is going to sink the logs. Select _View permissions_ from this dropdown.
* Click on the _APP PRINCIPAL_ button on the top. In the New principal's textbox, copy the value from the _Writer_ identity (remove the serviceAccount: prefix from the value), and select any value from the dropdown that appears. In the _Select a role_ dropdown, search for _Pub/Sub Publisher_ and select it.

</figure>

* Click on _Save_. With this, the Log Router sink now has permission to write to the Pub/Sub topic.
* Wait for ~1 minute for the permissions to take effect, and now trigger the Cloud Load Balancer a few times. You should see the Log Router's volume increasing, as well as the Pub/Sub topic's metrics showing up published requests.

After the log router configuration and permission is done, let’s configure the OTel collector to receive these logs.

### OTel Collector Configuration
Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance. 

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

**Step 1:** Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

**Step 2:** Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

**Step 3:** Create config.yaml in the folder _otelcol-contrib_ with the below content in it. Replace `<region>` with the appropriate SigNoz Cloud region. Replace `"<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"` with what is provided by SigNoz:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  googlecloudpubsub:
    project: <gcp-project-id>
    subscription: projects/<gcp-project-id>/subscriptions/lb-logs-signoz-sub-new-9-aug
    encoding: raw_text
processors:
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "<SigNoz-Key>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, googlecloudpubsub]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Step 4:** Once we are done with the above configurations, we can now run the collector service.
  
  *If you want to run otel collector process in the background*:

```sh
./otelcol-contrib --config ./config.yaml &> otelcol-output.log & echo "$!" > otel-pid
```

You can now trigger the Cloud Load Balancer a few times, and see the logs from the GCP Cloud Load Balancer on SigNoz.

### Visualize the logs in SigNoz Cloud

After the log router configuration and permission, let’s configure the OTel collector to receive these logs.

### OTel Collector Configuration
Follow the steps mentioned in the [Creating Compute Engine](https://signoz.io/docs/gcp-monitoring/bootstrapping/gce-creation/) document to create the Compute Engine instance. 

#### Install OTel Collector as agent

Firstly, we will establish the authentication using the following commands:

1. Initialize `gcloud`:

```
gcloud init
```

2. Authenticate into GCP:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Let us now proceed to the OTel Collector installation:

**Step 1:** Download otel-collector tar.gz for your architecture

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.116.0/otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

**Step 2:** Extract otel-collector tar.gz to the otelcol-contrib folder

```bash
mkdir otelcol-contrib && tar xvzf otelcol-contrib_0.116.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C otelcol-contrib
```

**Step 4:** Replace _otel-collector-contrib’s_ default configuration with the following config in  `/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml`.

```yaml
receivers:
  googlecloudpubsub/logs:
    project: omni-new
    subscription: projects/<your-project-id>/subscriptions/<name-of-the-pub-sub-subscription>
    encoding: cloud_logging # Make sure to use cloud_logging for logs
exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug  # Options: debug, info, warn, error
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "http://localhost:4318"  # Replace with your SigNoz OTLP HTTP endpoint
    compression: "gzip"
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [googlecloudpubsub/logs]
      exporters: [logging,otlphttp]        
```

Here `localhost:4318` is pointing to SigNoz's collector, use VM IP address or domain name in case of running `otel-collector-contrib` on some other host.

**Step 5:** Restart otel-collecotor-contrib with

```sh
systemctl restart otelcol-contrib
```

You can now trigger the Load Balancer a few times, and see the logs from the GCP Cloud Load Balancer on SigNoz.

### Visualize the logs in Self-Hosted SigNoz

That's it! You have successfully set up monitoring for your Cloud Load Balancer logs with Self-Hosted SigNoz.   

## Troubleshooting      

If you encounter any issues while setting up monitoring for your Cloud Load Balancer logs with Self-Hosted SigNoz, here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

* Verify that your Cloud Load Balancer is configured correctly and is accessible.
* Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the logs in your Load Balancer.
* Check and mention the correct URL for Self-Hosted SigNoz, along with the OpenTelemetry (OTel) configuration and routing details.

    ```sh
    journalctl -u otelcol-contrib.service --since "15 min  ago"
    ```
By following this guide, you should be able to easily send the logs from your Google Cloud Load Balancer to Self-Hosted SigNoz and gain valuable insights in case any issues arise.
