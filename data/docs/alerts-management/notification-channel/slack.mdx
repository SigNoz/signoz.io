## Accessing Alert Channels

To manage your alert channels in SigNoz:

- Navigate to `Settings > Alert Channels` tab within SigNoz. This tab displays a list of configured alert channels.

## Receive Alert in Slack

Once the configuration is set up correctly, you will receive alerts in the configured Slack channel whenever monitored metrics exceed the specified thresholds in alert rules. This ensures you are promptly notified of any issues in your applications or infrastructure components.
