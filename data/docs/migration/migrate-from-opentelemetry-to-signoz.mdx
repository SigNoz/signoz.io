description: Migrating from OpenTelemetry to SigNoz. How to migrate metrics, traces, and logs from OpenTelemetry to SigNoz.
---

If you already have OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your applications, you can easily switch to SigNoz as your observability backend. This guide will walk you through the simple configuration changes needed to start sending your metrics, traces, and logs to either SigNoz Cloud or Self-Hosted SigNoz.

## Why Use SigNoz as Your OpenTelemetry Backend?

While you may currently be using other backends for your OpenTelemetry data, SigNoz offers several advantages:

- **Unified Platform**: Single interface for metrics, traces, and logs without context switching
- **High Performance**: Optimized for handling large volumes of OpenTelemetry data
- **Advanced Features**: Comprehensive querying, alerting, and visualization capabilities specifically designed for OpenTelemetry data


## Migration Guides

Follow the guide that matches your preferred SigNoz deployment:
- **[Migrate to SigNoz Cloud](/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry/cloud/)** - is the fastest way to get started. It's a fully managed service available in multiple regions with built-in high availability - you just need an ingestion key to start sending data.
- **[Migrate to Self-Hosted SigNoz](/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry/self-hosted/)** - gives you complete control over your observability infrastructure. Deploy it on your own servers or cloud with customizable configuration and no external dependencies.
