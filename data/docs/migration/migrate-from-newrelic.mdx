SigNoz provides a unified OpenTelemetry native solution for monitoring metrics, traces, and logs,
allowing for greater flexibility and control over your data. This guide will walk you through the steps to migrate your
existing New Relic setup to SigNoz, covering all essential signals: metrics, traces, and logs.
