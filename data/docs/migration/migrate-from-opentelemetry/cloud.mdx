description: Step-by-step guide to send OpenTelemetry data to SigNoz Cloud
---

This guide walks you through configuring your existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation to send data to SigNoz Cloud. The process involves updating your export configuration - no changes to your application code are required.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Applications already instrumented with [OpenTelemetry SDKs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/)
- An active [SigNoz account](https://signoz.io/teams/)
- Access to modify your application configuration or environment variables
- A valid [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/) from your SigNoz Cloud account


## Configuration for SigNoz Cloud

### Step 1: Obtain Your Ingestion Key

First, you need to get your ingestion key from SigNoz Cloud:

1. Log into your [SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Ingestion Settings**
3. Copy your **Ingestion Key** - you'll need this for authentication



## Step 2: Get Your Region Endpoint

Next, you need to identify the correct ingestion endpoint for your SigNoz Cloud region.

Your endpoint URL depends on your selected region:

| Region | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| **United States** | `https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443` |
| **Europe** | `https://ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443` |
| **India** | `https://ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443` |

**Note**: SigNoz uses port 443 for both HTTP and gRPC protocols.

## Step 3: Update OpenTelemetry Configuration

Now that you have your endpoint and ingestion key, you need to [reconfigure your OpenTelemetry exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/) to send data to SigNoz Cloud. You can do this either through environment variables (recommended) or by updating your application code directly.

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set these environment variables for your application:

```bash
# Replace with your region's endpoint
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443"

# Replace with your actual ingestion key
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=YOUR_INGESTION_KEY"

# Enable compression for better performance
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_COMPRESSION="gzip"

# Optional: Increase timeout for large payloads
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT="30000"
```

### Step 4: Configure OpenTelemetry Collector (Optional)

If you're using an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) in your infrastructure to aggregate telemetry data before sending it to backends, you'll need to update its configuration to point to SigNoz Cloud.

Update your collector's configuration file:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "<YOUR-INGESTION-KEY>"
    tls:
      insecure: false

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

After updating the configuration, restart your OpenTelemetry Collector to apply the changes.

## Step 5: Test and Validate

Now it's time to verify that your OpenTelemetry data is successfully flowing to SigNoz Cloud.

1. **Restart your application** with the new configuration
2. **Generate test data** by using your application
3. **Access SigNoz Dashboard** - [log into your SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/login/)
4. **Verify data flow**:
   - Navigate to **Services** tab - your applications should appear
   - Check **Traces** for individual requests
   - Verify **Metrics** and **Logs** if configured

Data should appear within 1-2 minutes. If not, check your application logs for export errors.

## Next Steps

Now that your OpenTelemetry data is flowing to SigNoz Cloud:

- **Set up alerts**: Configure [alerting rules](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/alerts-management/) for key metrics
- **Create dashboards**: Build custom [dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) for your team
- **Explore APM features**: Use [distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/traces/) to troubleshoot issues
- **Monitor infrastructure**: Set up [infrastructure monitoring](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-metrics/)
