title: Migrate Dashboard from Honeycomb to SigNoz
description: Learn how to migrate Honeycomb dashboards and queries to SigNoz with comprehensive query translation patterns.
---

Since both platforms are now OpenTelemetry-native, the migration primarily focuses on translating Honeycomb's 
proprietary query syntax to PromQL and ClickHouse SQL, while leveraging SigNoz's enhanced visualization and querying capabilities.

## SigNoz Dashboard Templates

SigNoz provides an extensive library of pre-built dashboard templates for common observability scenarios, making migration easier by providing starting points for your Honeycomb dashboards.

### Using Dashboard Templates

Visit the [SigNoz Dashboard Templates repository](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards) to explore available templates.

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** in SigNoz
2. Click **"+ New Dashboard"**
3. Select **"Choose from template"**
4. Click **Import JSON**
5. Either paste or upload the dashboard JSON file from the repository

## Requesting Custom Dashboards

You can also request SigNoz to help you with creating custom dashboards. To request a custom dashboard, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dashboard-template&template=request_dashboard.md&title=%5BDashboard+Request%5D+) providing details about the dashboard you want to create.

### Creating Custom Dashboards

In case there is no existing dashboard template that you can use, you can create a custom dashboard in SigNoz. Please follow [Manage Dashboards in SigNoz documentation](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard/) for more details.

## SigNoz Dashboard Features

### Panel Types and Visualization Options

When recreating your Honeycomb boards in SigNoz, it's important to understand which visualization types are available. SigNoz supports most common panel types and provides additional options beyond Honeycomb's capabilities:

| Panel Type | Honeycomb | SigNoz | Notes |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Time Series | ✓ | ✓ | Both platforms support time series visualization |
| Table | ✓ | ✓ | Both support tabular data display |
| Bar Chart | - | ✓ | Enhanced visualization option in SigNoz |
| Pie Chart | - | ✓ | Enhanced visualization option in SigNoz |
| Value/Single Stat | - | ✓ | Single value display with thresholds |
| Heatmap | ✓ | - | Use histogram metrics as alternative |
| Text Panel | ✓ | - | Use dashboard descriptions or annotations |
| SLO Panel | ✓ | - | Recreate using custom alert rules |

For panels that don't have a direct equivalent in SigNoz, consider how you might achieve similar functionality using available visualization types. For example, Honeycomb's SLO panels can be replaced with custom alert rules and value panels showing SLO compliance metrics.

Please refer to the [Panel Types](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/panel-types/) documentation for more details on the panel types supported by SigNoz.

### Dashboard Features

SigNoz supports essential dashboard features including:

**Variables**: Create template variables for dynamic dashboards  
**Query Builder**: [The Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder-v5/) is SigNoz's structured query interface that combines the power of expression-based querying with intelligent auto-completion  
**Filters**: Apply filters across panels and data sources  
**Sharing**: Share dashboards with team members and external users  
**Time Controls**: Flexible time range selection and auto-refresh  

For detailed dashboard management, refer to the [Manage Dashboards](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) documentation.


## Honeycomb to SigNoz Functionality Mapping

### Basic Query Translation

Honeycomb uses proprietary query syntax while SigNoz uses standard PromQL for metrics and ClickHouse SQL for logs/traces. You can use SigNoz's [Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder-v5/) for visual query construction or write queries directly. Below are the most common query patterns and their SigNoz equivalents:

| Honeycomb Query | SigNoz Equivalent | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `COUNT` | `sum(rate(metric[5m]))` | PromQL rate function |
| `COUNT WHERE condition` | `sum(rate(metric{condition}[5m]))` | Label filtering |
| `AVG(field)` | `avg(metric)` | Direct translation |
| `P95(field)`, `P99(field)` | `histogram_quantile(0.95, ...)` | Histogram metrics required |
| `GROUP BY field` | `by (label)` in PromQL | Label-based grouping |
| `RATE PER SECOND` | `rate(metric[5m])` | Built-in PromQL function |

Each Honeycomb query needs to be rewritten for SigNoz using PromQL or ClickHouse SQL syntax, with appropriate field names and aggregation functions.


Migrating dashboards from Honeycomb to SigNoz involves translating proprietary query syntax to standard PromQL and ClickHouse SQL. SigNoz's extensive template library, enhanced panel types, and unified observability approach provide significant advantages over Honeycomb's board-based system, enabling better visualization and correlation across metrics, logs, and traces.


## Next Steps

With your dashboards successfully migrated from Honeycomb to SigNoz:

1. **[Migrate Alerts](/docs/migration/migrate-from-honeycomb/alerts/)** - Convert Honeycomb triggers and SLOs to SigNoz alert rules for your dashboard metrics
2. **Optimize dashboards** - Explore [advanced Query Builder features](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder-v5/) and [dashboard management](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/) for enhanced team collaboration
