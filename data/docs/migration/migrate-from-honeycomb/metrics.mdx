title: Migrate Metrics from Honeycomb to SigNoz
description: Learn how to migrate metrics and SLOs from Honeycomb to SigNoz using Prometheus receiver, OTLP metrics.
---


With Honeycomb's transition to OpenTelemetry-first approach, migrating your metrics monitoring to SigNoz becomes straightforward while offering enhanced capabilities through unified observability.
This guide walks you through migrating custom metrics, converting SLOs to alert rules, and leveraging SigNoz's comprehensive metrics platform.

## Prerequisites

- [SigNoz Cloud account](https://signoz.io/teams/) or [self-hosted SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/) setup
- [OpenTelemetry data flowing to SigNoz](/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry-to-signoz/)
- Access to your current Honeycomb metrics and derived columns
- Understanding of your existing SLO definitions


## Understanding the Migration Path

### Honeycomb Metrics Model

Honeycomb treats metrics as derived insights from events:

- **Derived Columns**: Calculated fields from trace and event data
- **Custom Events**: Application-specific metrics sent as structured events  
- **SLOs**: Service Level Objectives based on event query aggregations
- **Triggers**: Alert conditions based on query thresholds and burn rates

### SigNoz Unified Metrics Platform

SigNoz provides comprehensive metrics capabilities:

- **Native OpenTelemetry**: OTLP metrics ingestion with full semantic conventions
- **Prometheus Compatible**: Complete PromQL support and Prometheus ecosystem integration
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Built-in host, container, and Kubernetes metrics
- **Unified Dashboards**: Metrics, logs, and traces correlation in single interface
- **Advanced Alerting**: Multi-condition rules with notification channel integrations

## Migration Strategy

### Path 1: Already Using OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb

If you're already sending OpenTelemetry data to Honeycomb via OTLP, migration is simply changing endpoints. **No SDK changes needed** since both platforms use OpenTelemetry.


**Current Configuration (Honeycomb):**
```yaml
# OpenTelemetry Collector config
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "api.honeycomb.io:443"
    headers:
      "x-honeycomb-team": "${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
      "x-honeycomb-dataset": "your-dataset"
```

**Updated Configuration [(SigNoz Cloud)](/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry/cloud/):**
```yaml
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "${SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY}"
```

**Updated Configuration [(Self-hosted SigNoz)](/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry/self-hosted/):**
```yaml
exporters:
  clickhousemetricsexporter:
    dsn: tcp://clickhouse:9000/?database=signoz_metrics
    timeout: 5s
```

**Application Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Before (Honeycomb)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io:443
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY"

# After (SigNoz Cloud)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=YOUR_SIGNOZ_KEY"
```
### Path 2: Using Legacy Honeycomb SDKs (Two-Step Migration)

If you're using legacy Honeycomb SDKs (Beelines, Honeycomb Distributions), you need a two-step approach:

#### Migrate to OpenTelemetry First

**Follow Honeycomb's official migration documentation to move from legacy SDKs to OpenTelemetry:**

- **[Migrate from Honeycomb Distributions](https://docs.honeycomb.io/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/recommended-migrations/migrate-from-honeycomb-distributions/)**
- **[Migrating from Beeline SDKs](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/beelines/)**

This ensures you:
- Replace legacy SDK calls with OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Configure proper metric collection using OpenTelemetry standards
- Maintain compatibility with both Honeycomb (during testing) and SigNoz

#### Step 2: Change OpenTelemetry Endpoint to SigNoz

Once you've migrated to OpenTelemetry and verified your metrics work with Honeycomb, follow **Path 1** above to change the endpoint to SigNoz.


## Configure Additional Metrics Sources

After completing the basic OpenTelemetry endpoint migration, you may need to configure additional metrics collection methods to capture all your Honeycomb metrics in SigNoz.

SigNoz supports multiple metrics ingestion methods:
- **OTLP Metrics**: Direct from OpenTelemetry SDKs (primary method)
- **Prometheus Receiver**: For existing Prometheus metrics endpoints
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific business metrics

The following sections guide you through setting up these additional metrics sources.


## 1. Enable Metrics Collection in SigNoz

### Configure Prometheus Receiver

Enable the Prometheus receiver in your SigNoz OpenTelemetry Collector configuration to scrape existing Prometheus metrics:

```yaml
# otel-collector-config.yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      global:
        scrape_interval: 15s
        evaluation_interval: 15s
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'my-application'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8080']
          metrics_path: '/metrics'
          scrape_interval: 30s

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"  # For SigNoz Cloud
    headers:
      "signoz-access-token": "${SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY}"

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

For detailed Prometheus receiver setup, follow the [Prometheus Receiver configuration guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/send-metrics/#enable-a-prometheus-receiver).

### Configure OTLP Metrics

If your applications use OpenTelemetry SDKs, ensure metrics are enabled:

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443/v1/metrics
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=${SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY}"
```

## Using the SigNoz Metrics Explorer

SigNoz Metrics Explorer allows you to query, filter, and visualize your metrics data using PromQL or the visual [Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder-v5/).

<Figure src="/img/docs/migration/metrics-explorer.webp" alt="SigNoz Metrics Explorer" caption="SigNoz Metrics Explorer interface" />

To explore your metrics in SigNoz:

1. In the SigNoz UI, click on `Metrics` in the left sidebar
2. Find a metric from the `List View`
3. Check metric attributes by clicking on the metric name
4. Alternatively, use the `Search Filter` to find metrics with specific attributes

---

## 2. Verifying Metrics in SigNoz

After updating your configuration, restart your applications and verify that metrics are flowing to SigNoz:
1. Check Metrics Explorer - Navigate to the Metrics tab in SigNoz to confirm your custom metrics are appearing
2. Verify metric names - Ensure your application metrics show up with expected names and labels
3. Test queries - Use the Query Builder or PromQL to validate metric data

## Next Steps

Now that metrics are flowing to SigNoz, continue with:

1. **[Migrate Dashboards](/docs/migration/migrate-from-honeycomb/dashboards/)** - Recreate your Honeycomb boards and queries in SigNoz
2. **[Migrate Alerts](/docs/migration/migrate-from-honeycomb/alerts/)** - Convert SLOs and triggers to SigNoz alert rules  
3. **[Explore Metrics Features](/docs/userguide/metrics/)** - Learn advanced SigNoz Metrics Explorer capabilities
