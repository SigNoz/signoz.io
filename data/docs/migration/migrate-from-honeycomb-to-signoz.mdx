description: Migrating from Honeycomb to SigNoz.
---

This documentation will guide you through migrating from Honeycomb to SigNoz, leveraging the fact that both platforms now use OpenTelemetry as their primary instrumentation standard. With [Honeycomb's transition to OpenTelemetry-first approach and deprecation of legacy SDKs by August 12, 2025](https://docs.honeycomb.io/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/recommended-migrations/), the migration path has been significantly simplified.
This guide will walk you through the migration process for both SigNoz Cloud and Self-Hosted deployments.

## Why Migrate to SigNoz?

SigNoz offers several advantages over Honeycomb:

- **Unified Observability**: Logs, metrics, and traces in one platform

- **Cost-Effective**: Predictable pricing without per-event charges

- **Open Source**: Full control over your observability stack
- **OpenTelemetry Native**: Built from the ground up with OpenTelemetry
- **Self-Hosted Option**: Keep your data on your infrastructure


## Migration Strategy

The migration strategy depends on your current setup:

### For OpenTelemetry Users (Simplified Path)
If you're already using OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb, migration is straightforward - [**simply change your OTLP endpoint**] to point to SigNoz. No SDK changes or re-instrumentation required.

### For Legacy SDK Users (Two-Step Process)
If you're still using Honeycomb's legacy SDKs, follow this approach:

1. **First**: Migrate from legacy Honeycomb SDKs to OpenTelemetry:
   - [Migrate from Beelines](https://docs.honeycomb.io/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/recommended-migrations/migrate-from-beelines/)
   - [Migrate from Honeycomb Distributions](https://docs.honeycomb.io/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/recommended-migrations/migrate-from-honeycomb-distributions/)

2. **Then**: Follow the OpenTelemetry endpoint configuration steps in this guide

## Honeycomb vs SigNoz Feature Mapping

| Honeycomb Feature | SigNoz Equivalent | Migration Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Derived Columns | PromQL Queries | Convert aggregations to PromQL expressions |
| Custom Metrics | OTLP Metrics + Prometheus | Use OpenTelemetry SDKs or Prometheus format |
| SLOs | Alert Rules | Convert to PromQL-based alert conditions |
| Triggers | Alert Manager | Configure notification channels and rules |
| Heatmaps | Histogram Metrics | Use histogram_quantile() functions |
| Rate Calculations | rate() function | Built-in PromQL rate calculations |
