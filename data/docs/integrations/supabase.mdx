title: Supabase Metrics Integration
description: Monitor your Supabase project health and performance in SigNoz by collecting platform metrics.
---

Monitor your Supabase projectâ€™s health and performance in SigNoz by collecting platform metrics via the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Collector and Prometheus receiver.

## How Supabase Metrics Integration Works

- **Supabase exposes a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint** for each project:  
  ```
  https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/customer/v1/privileged/metrics
  ```
- **Authentication:**  
  - Username: `service_role`  
  - Password: Your Supabase service role JWT (from the Supabase dashboard)
- **Metrics update frequency:** Every minute

For more details on metrics, see the [Supabase metrics documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/metrics#supabase-grafana).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A **Supabase project** with access to the metrics endpoint  
- An **OpenTelemetry Collector** installed and reachable  
  - [Install OpenTelemetry Collector if not already installed](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/get-started/)
- A **SigNoz instance** to receive metrics

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Collector Config

Create a file named `supabase-metrics-collection-config.yaml`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: "MySupabaseJob"
          metrics_path: "/customer/v1/privileged/metrics"
          scheme: https
          basic_auth:
            username: "service_role"
            password: "<YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_JWT>"
          static_configs:
            - targets: ["<YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co:443"]
              labels:
                group: "MyGroupLabel"
processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.<YOUR_REGION>.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "<YOUR_INGESTION_KEY>"

service:
  extensions: [health_check, pprof, zpages]
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```
- `<YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_JWT>`: Replace this with your Supabase project's Service Role JWT, which you can find in your [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys).
- `<YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID>`: Replace this with your Supabase project ID, which you can find in your Supabase dashboard URL (e.g., `https://<YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co`).  
<Admonition>
- Set your ingestion endpoint according to your SigNoz Cloud region. Refer to [the SigNoz Cloud ingestion endpoint guide](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/) to find the correct endpoint for your deployment.
- Replace `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with the one provided by SigNoz.

### Step 2: Start the Collector

Start the Collector with the following command:

```bash
 --config supabase-metrics-collection-config.yaml
```

### Step 3: Verify the Metrics

Verify the metrics are being collected by SigNoz.
