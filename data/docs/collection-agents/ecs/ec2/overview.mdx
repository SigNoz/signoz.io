## What is ECS Daemon Service Collection?

This documentation explains how to collect metrics and logs from your Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) infrastructure using a daemon service approach. The daemon service runs a container on each node of your ECS cluster to collect infrastructure metrics and logs, then forwards them to SigNoz for monitoring and analysis.

## How It Works

The daemon service approach involves deploying a specialized container that:

1. **Runs as a daemon**: The service deploys one container per ECS cluster node
2. **Collects infrastructure data**: Gathers metrics and logs from the host instance and Docker containers
3. **Acts as a gateway**: Receives OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) telemetry data from your applications
4. **Forwards to SigNoz**: Sends all collected data to your SigNoz instance for visualization and analysis

## Architecture Overview

```
ECS Cluster Nodes
├── Your Application Containers
├── Daemon Service Container (OpenTelemetry Collector)
│   ├── Collects host metrics
│   ├── Collects container logs  
│   ├── Receives OTLP data from apps
│   └── Forwards data to SigNoz
```

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the daemon service, ensure you have:

- **ECS Cluster**: An active ECS cluster with at least one task definition
- **Launch Type**: Your ECS cluster must use either **EC2** or **External** launch type
- **SigNoz Instance**: Either SigNoz Cloud account or self-hosted SigNoz installation
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate permissions for ECS and CloudFormation operations
- **IAM Permissions**: Access to create CloudFormation stacks, ECS services, and Parameter Store resources

> **Note for Fargate Users**: If you're using Fargate launch type, this daemon service approach won't work. Instead, check out the [ECS Sidecar documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/overview) for Fargate-compatible collection methods.

## What Data Gets Collected?

- **Infrastructure metrics** (CPU, memory, network, disk, container resource usage)
- **Container and system logs** (application, system, Docker daemon logs)
- **Application telemetry** (traces, custom metrics, OTLP-compatible data)


## Launch Type

- **EC2**: Fully supported; collects host metrics/logs with host network access.
- **External**: Supported for hybrid/external resources; may need extra network setup.
