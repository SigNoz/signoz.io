title: ECS Serverless Collection Agent - Configure
description: Configure your sidecar service and set up application data collection for ECS Serverless Infrastructure
---

This guide explains how to configure your ECS sidecar service, verify data flow, and set up application data collection.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the [installation steps](/docs/collection-agents/ecs/sidecar/install/)
- Sidecar container running in your ECS tasks
- Access to SigNoz Cloud or self-hosted instance

## Verify Data Collection

Log into your SigNoz instance and check that infrastructure data is being received. You should see ECS metrics and logs in the relevant sections.

To visualize ECS data, import pre-built dashboards:

- [container-metrics.json](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/raw/main/ecs-infra-metrics/container-metrics.json)
- [hostmetrics.json](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/raw/main/hostmetrics/hostmetrics.json)

Import these in the **Dashboards** section of SigNoz.

## Send Data from Applications

To send data from your ECS applications to SigNoz via the sidecar:

### 1. Instrument Your Application

Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation to your application. See [SigNoz instrumentation docs](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/).

### 2. Configure OTLP Endpoint

Set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable in your application container to point to the sidecar.

```json
{
    ...
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "<your-container-name>",
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT",
                    "value": "http://signoz-collector:4317"
                },
                {
                    "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
                    "value": "service.name=<your-service-name>"
                }
            ],
            "links": [
                "signoz-collector"
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="awsvpc" label="AWS VPC">

```json
{
    ...
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "<your-container-name>",
            "environment": [
                {
                    "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT",
                    "value": "http://localhost:4317"
                },
                {
                    "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
                    "value": "service.name=<your-service-name>"
                }
            ],
            ...
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Add Service Name of your Application

To add the service name of your application, you need to set the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable of the application container to `service.name=<your-service-name>`.

In your task definition, you can add the following lines:

```yaml
ContainerDefinitions:
    - Name: <your-container-name>
      
      Environment:
        - Name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
          Value: service.name=<your-service-name>
```

In case of JSON task definition, you can add the following lines:

```json
"containerDefinitions": [
    {
        "name": "<your-container-name>",
        
        "environment": [
            {
                "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
                "value": "service.name=<your-service-name>"
            }
        ],
        
    }
],
```

## Send Logs Data from Applications

In this section, we will see how to send logs data from applications deployed in ECS to SigNoz using the sidecar container that we deployed in the previous section.

### 1. Configure Log Router

In your application code, you need to configure the Fluent Bit log router to your application to the sidecar otel-collector container.

```json
{
    ...
    {
        "name": "signoz-log-router",
        "image": "906394416424.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-for-fluent-bit:stable",
        "cpu": 250,
        "memory": 512,
        "essential": true,
        "dependsOn": [
            {
                "containerName": "signoz-collector",
                "condition": "HEALTHY"
            }
        ],
        "logConfiguration": {
            "logDriver": "awslogs",
            "options": {
                "awslogs-create-group": "True",
                "awslogs-group": "/ecs/ecs-signoz-log-router",
                "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
                "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
            }
        },
        "firelensConfiguration": {
            "type": "fluentbit",
            "options": {
                "enable-ecs-log-metadata": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<Admonition type="info">
When collecting logs from multiple applications, it is recommended to use `<application-name>-log-router` pattern instead of `signoz-log-router` for container name and `awslogs-group`. It helps to separate log router of different application.
</Admonition>

### 2. Send Logs to Sidecar Container

In your application task definition, you need to use `awsfirelens` log driver to send logs to the sidecar otel-collector container via Fluent Bit log router.

```json
{
    ...
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "<your-container-name>",
            "dependsOn": [
                {
                    "containerName": "signoz-log-router",
                    "condition": "START"
                }
            ],
            "logConfiguration": {
                "logDriver": "awsfirelens",

                    "Port": "8006",
                    "tls": "off",
                    "tls.verify": "off"
                }
            },
            "links": [
                "signoz-collector"
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

<TabItem value="awsvpc" label="AWS VPC">

{
    ...
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "<your-container-name>",
            "dependsOn": [
                {
                    "containerName": "signoz-log-router",

                }
            }
            ...
        }
    ]
}

## Customize Collection Settings

### Modify Collection Intervals

You can adjust how frequently the sidecar container collects data by modifying the configuration in AWS Parameter Store:

1. Navigate to **AWS Systems Manager > Parameter Store**
2. Find the `/ecs/signoz/otelcol-sidecar.yaml` parameter
3. Edit the parameter value
4. Modify collection intervals in the configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  awsecscontainermetrics:
    collection_interval: 20s  # Adjust this value
  
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 30s  # Adjust this value
```

5. Save the parameter
6. Restart your ECS tasks to apply the new configuration

### Filter Specific Metrics

To collect only specific metrics, you can modify the configuration to include only the scrapers you need:

```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    scrapers:
      cpu:        # Only CPU metrics
      memory:     # Only memory metrics
      # Comment out or remove scrapers you don't need
      # disk:
      # network:
      # filesystem:
```

### Customize Log Collection

To customize log collection, you can modify the filelog receiver configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log]
    start_at: end
    include_file_name: false
    include_file_path: true
    operators:
    - id: container-parser
      type: container
    # Add custom log parsing operators here
```

## Troubleshooting Configuration

### Common Issues

**No Data in SigNoz:**
- Verify the sidecar container is running and healthy
- Check CloudWatch logs for the sidecar container
- Ensure the OTLP endpoint is correctly configured
- Verify IAM permissions for Parameter Store access

**Application Traces Not Appearing:**
- Confirm the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set correctly
- Check that the application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry
- Verify the sidecar container ports are accessible
- Ensure the service name is properly configured

**Logs Not Being Collected:**
- Verify the log router container is running
- Check the `awsfirelens` log driver configuration
- Ensure the sidecar container is accessible on port 8006
- Verify the log router has proper dependencies configured
