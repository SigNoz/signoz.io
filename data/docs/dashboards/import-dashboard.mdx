title: Import Dashboard in SigNoz
---

SigNoz provides a variety of out-of-the-box dashboards that you can use to monitor your applications and infrastructure. 

## Steps to import dashboard

### Step 1: Find a dashboard template

Navigate to the [Dashboards](https://signoz.io/dashboards) page to explore the available dashboard templates. You can find dashboards for 
various services like databases, web servers, and more.

### Step 2: Copy/Download the dashboard JSON

You can choose any dashboard you’d like to use. For instance, to monitor a MySQL database, click the [MySQL dashboard](https://signoz.io/docs/dashboards/dashboard-templates/mysql/) icon. On that page, you’ll see options to copy or download the dashboard JSON file.

### Step 3: Import the dashboard in SigNoz

In your SigNoz UI, go to the **Dashboards** page and click on the **+ New dashboard** button. You will see an option to **Import JSON**.

        alt="Import JSON"
    />
    <figcaption>
        <i>

        </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

You can either paste the JSON that you copied or upload the JSON file that you downloaded.

<figure data-zoomable align="left">
    <img
        src="/img/docs/dashboards/import-dashboard/paste-or-upload-dashboard-json.webp"
        alt="Paste or Upload Dashboard JSON"
    />
    <figcaption>
        <i>
        Paste or Upload Dashboard JSON
        </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Once the JSON is imported, you will see the new dashboard on your dashboards page.
