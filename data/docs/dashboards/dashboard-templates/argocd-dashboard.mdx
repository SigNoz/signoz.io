## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential ArgoCD metrics to help you:

- **Application Health Monitoring**: Track the health status of ArgoCD applications across different states
- **Sync Status Tracking**: Monitor application synchronization status and identify out-of-sync applications
- **Controller Performance**: Analyze ArgoCD controller performance and reconciliation activities
- **Cluster Statistics**: Monitor Kubernetes cluster resources and API activity
- **Repository Server Metrics**: Track Git repository interactions and fetch operations
- **Workqueue Analysis**: Monitor ArgoCD workqueue depth and processing efficiency

## Metrics Included

### Overview Section

#### Number Of Applications
- **Applications Graph**: Time-series visualization showing total number of applications by health status:
  - Grouped by health status for trend analysis
  - Filtered by namespace and repository for focused monitoring

#### Repository Servers
- **Repository Count**: Shows the total number of repository servers configured in ArgoCD

#### Applications By Repository
- **Repository Distribution**: Displays application count grouped by repository:
  - Helps identify repository usage patterns
  - Useful for capacity planning and load distribution

### Application Health Section

#### Health Status Metrics
- **Healthy**: Number of applications in healthy state (green indicator)
- **Progressing**: Number of applications currently in progress (blue indicator)
- **Suspended**: Number of suspended applications (red background indicator)
- **Degraded**: Number of degraded applications (red text indicator)

### Application Sync Status Section

#### Synchronization Tracking
- **Synced**: Graph showing applications that are in sync with their Git repositories
  - Grouped by repository for detailed analysis
  - Essential for ensuring deployments are up-to-date

- **OutOfSync**: Graph displaying applications that are out of sync
  - Critical for identifying deployment drift
  - Grouped by repository for targeted remediation

### Controller Stats Section

#### Sync and Reconciliation Activity
- **Sync Activity**: Shows different phases of sync operations:
  - **Succeeded**: Successful sync operations
  - **Failed**: Failed sync attempts  
  - **Error**: Sync operations that encountered errors

- **Reconciliation Activity**: Displays application reconciliation count over time
  - Tracks controller workload and processing efficiency

#### Performance Metrics
- **Count of Application Reconciliation by Duration Bounds**: Histogram showing reconciliation performance distribution
- **Reconciliation Performance**: Detailed performance analysis by duration buckets
- **K8s API Activity**: Monitors Kubernetes API requests during application reconciliation:
  - Grouped by verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and resource kind
  - Essential for understanding API load patterns

- **Workqueue Depth**: Current depth of ArgoCD workqueue
  - Indicates controller processing capacity and potential bottlenecks

### Cluster Stats Section

#### Cluster Resource Monitoring
- **Age of Cluster Cache**: Tracks cluster cache freshness in seconds
  - Critical for ensuring up-to-date cluster state information

- **Count of Cluster Resource Objects**: Number of Kubernetes resource objects in the cache
  - Grouped by server for multi-cluster environments

- **Count of Cluster Events**: Tracks processed Kubernetes events
  - Important for monitoring cluster activity levels

- **Count of API Resources**: Number of monitored Kubernetes API resources
  - Helps understand the scope of monitoring coverage

### Repo Server Stats Section

#### Git Repository Activity
- **Count of Git Ls-Remote Requests**: Tracks Git ls-remote operations by repository
  - Important for monitoring repository connectivity and health

- **Count of Git Fetch Requests**: Shows Git fetch operations by repository
  - Critical for understanding repository synchronization activity

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes pre-configured variables for filtering:

- **health.status**: Filter by application health status (Healthy, Progressing, Suspended, Degraded, etc.)
- **namespace**: Filter by Kubernetes namespace for environment-specific monitoring
- **repo**: Filter by Git repository name for repository-specific analysis
