title: AWS SQS Prometheus Dashboard
description: Monitor AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) using Prometheus metrics with comprehensive queue status tracking, message counts, and processing states across different environments and regions.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) using Prometheus metrics collected via a third-party exporter. It offers detailed visibility into queue message states, processing status, and capacity utilization to help optimize queue performance and troubleshoot message processing issues.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential AWS SQS metrics to help you:

- **Queue Health Monitoring**: Track message states across different queue phases
- **Message Flow Analysis**: Monitor visible, delayed, and in-flight message counts
- **Processing Efficiency**: Identify bottlenecks and processing delays
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand queue utilization patterns and scaling needs
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Monitor queues across different deployment environments
- **Regional Monitoring**: Track SQS performance across AWS regions

## Prerequisites

This dashboard is built using metrics from the **third-party SQS Prometheus exporter**:
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/jmal98/sqs-exporter](https://github.com/jmal98/sqs-exporter)
- **Setup Required**: Deploy the SQS exporter to collect metrics from your AWS SQS queues
- **Prometheus Integration**: Ensure the exporter is configured to send metrics to your Prometheus instance

## Metrics Included

### Queue Message Status Overview

#### Status of Messages in Queue
- **Description**: Comprehensive view of all message states within selected queues
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - **Delayed Messages**: Messages waiting to be available for processing
  - **Visible Messages**: Messages ready for immediate consumption
  - **Not Visible Messages**: Messages currently being processed (in-flight)
- **Use Case**: Get a complete picture of queue processing state at a glance
- **Grouping**: By queue name for multi-queue monitoring

### Individual Message State Metrics

#### Approximate Number of Messages
- **Description**: Count of messages available for retrieval from the queue
- **Metric**: `sqs_approximatenumberofmessages`
- **Use Case**: Monitor queue depth and consumer demand
- **Critical for**: Understanding processing backlog and scaling decisions

#### Approximate Number of Messages Delayed
- **Description**: Count of messages that are delayed and not yet available for reading
- **Metric**: `sqs_approximatenumberofmessagesdelayed`
- **Use Case**: Track scheduled or delayed message processing
- **Planning**: Essential for understanding future processing load

#### Approximate Number of Messages Not Visible
- **Description**: Count of messages that have not timed-out and aren't deleted (in-flight)
- **Metric**: `sqs_approximatenumberofmessagesnotvisible`
- **Use Case**: Monitor concurrent message processing and consumer activity
- **Performance**: High values may indicate slow processing or consumer issues

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes comprehensive filtering capabilities:

### Region Selection
- **Variable**: `region`
- **Description**: Select specific AWS region for monitoring
- **Type**: Single selection
- **Dynamic**: Populated from available SQS metrics

### Queue Selection
- **Variable**: `queue.name`
- **Description**: Select one or multiple SQS queues to monitor
- **Type**: Multi-select with "All" option
- **Flexibility**: Monitor specific queues or all queues simultaneously

### Environment Selection
- **Variable**: `deployment.environment`
- **Description**: Filter by deployment environment (staging, production, etc.)
- **Type**: Single selection
- **Use Case**: Environment-specific monitoring and troubleshooting

## Message State Definitions

### Visible Messages
- **State**: Ready for immediate processing
- **Consumer Action**: Can be received and processed
- **Monitoring**: Track for queue backlog and consumer capacity

### Delayed Messages
- **State**: Scheduled for future availability
- **Consumer Action**: Not yet available for processing
- **Monitoring**: Track scheduled workload and timing patterns

### Not Visible (In-Flight) Messages
- **State**: Currently being processed by consumers
- **Consumer Action**: Received but not yet deleted
- **Monitoring**: Indicates active processing and consumer performance
