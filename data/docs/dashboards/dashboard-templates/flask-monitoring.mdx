## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential Flask application performance metrics to help you:

- **Request Rate Monitoring**: Track incoming request volume and throughput patterns
- **Response Time Analysis**: Monitor application response times and latency percentiles
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Identify and analyze application errors and failure patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze request duration distributions for performance tuning
- **Endpoint Analysis**: Monitor specific Flask routes and their performance characteristics

## Metrics Included

### Request Volume and Rate

#### Requests Per Second
- **Description**: Rate of successful HTTP requests (status 200) processed by the Flask application
- **Metric Source**: `flask_http_request_duration_seconds.count` with status filter
- **Use Case**: Monitor application load and traffic patterns
- **Grouping**: By path for endpoint-specific analysis
- **Critical for**: Capacity planning and load balancing decisions

### Response Time Analysis

#### Average Response Time
- **Description**: Mean response time for successful requests across Flask endpoints
- **Metric Source**: `flask_http_request_duration_seconds.sum` divided by count
- **Use Case**: Track overall application performance and identify slow endpoints
- **Grouping**: By path to identify performance bottlenecks per route
- **Optimization**: Higher values indicate need for performance optimization

#### Request Duration P90
- **Description**: 90th percentile response time for successful requests
- **Metric Source**: PromQL histogram quantile calculation from duration buckets
- **Query**: `histogram_quantile(0.9, rate(flask_http_request_duration_seconds.bucket[30s]))`
- **Use Case**: Monitor tail latency and ensure consistent user experience
- **SLA Monitoring**: Critical for performance SLA compliance

### Error Monitoring

#### Errors Per Second
- **Description**: Rate of all HTTP requests regardless of status code
- **Metric Source**: `flask_http_request_duration_seconds.count` without status filtering
- **Use Case**: Track overall request volume including errors for error rate calculation
- **Analysis**: Compare with successful requests to calculate error percentage
- **Alerting**: Essential for identifying application issues and outages

### Performance Insights

#### Request Rate by Endpoint
- **Visualization**: Time-series graph showing request patterns
- **Filtering**: Focused on successful requests (HTTP 200 status)
- **Benefits**: Identify popular endpoints and traffic distribution
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand which routes require optimization

#### Latency Distribution
- **Analysis**: P90 latency tracking for performance monitoring
- **Histogram Data**: Utilizes Flask's duration histogram buckets
- **Performance Tuning**: Identify endpoints with inconsistent response times
- **User Experience**: Monitor tail latency impact on user satisfaction

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard can be enhanced with filtering variables for:

- **instance**: Filter by specific Flask application instances
- **path**: Focus on particular Flask routes or endpoints
- **method**: Filter by HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **status**: Monitor specific HTTP status codes

## Flask Metrics Integration

### Prometheus Flask Exporter
- **Required**: Flask application instrumented with prometheus_flask_exporter
- **Metrics Collection**: Automatic HTTP request duration and count metrics
- **Installation**: `pip install prometheus-flask-exporter`
- **Integration**: Simple decorator-based instrumentation

### Metric Details
- **flask_http_request_duration_seconds**: Histogram of request durations
- **Labels**: Includes method, status, and path for detailed analysis
- **Bucket Configuration**: Configurable latency buckets for histogram analysis
