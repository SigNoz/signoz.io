title: AWS ElastiCache Redis Dashboard
description: Monitor AWS ElastiCache Redis instances with comprehensive CloudWatch metrics including CPU utilization, memory usage, network traffic, cache performance, and replication metrics.
---

This dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of AWS ElastiCache Redis instances using CloudWatch metrics. It offers detailed visibility into both host-level metrics (CPU, memory, network) and Redis engine-specific metrics (cache hits, evictions, replication lag) to help optimize cache performance and troubleshoot issues.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential AWS ElastiCache Redis metrics to help you:

- **Performance Monitoring**: Track CPU utilization, memory usage, and cache hit rates
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor memory usage percentages and capacity utilization
- **Network Analysis**: Analyze network traffic patterns and bandwidth utilization
- **Cache Efficiency**: Track cache hit rates, evictions, and memory fragmentation
- **Replication Health**: Monitor replication lag and connection metrics
- **Resource Optimization**: Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize configurations

## Metrics Included

### CPU and Engine Performance

#### CPU Utilization
- **Description**: Host-level CPU utilization percentage for the ElastiCache node
- **Use Case**: Monitor overall system performance and identify CPU bottlenecks
- **Grouping**: By cache cluster ID for multi-cluster monitoring

#### Engine CPU Utilization
- **Description**: Redis engine-specific CPU utilization percentage
- **Use Case**: Track Redis process CPU consumption separate from system overhead
- **Grouping**: By cache cluster ID to compare engine performance across clusters

### Memory Management

#### Database Memory Usage Percentage
- **Description**: Percentage of allocated memory currently used by Redis
- **Use Case**: Monitor memory consumption and plan for capacity needs
- **Critical Thresholds**: High values (>80%) may indicate need for scaling

#### Database Capacity Usage Percentage
- **Description**: Percentage of total available memory capacity in use
- **Use Case**: Track capacity utilization for scaling decisions
- **Planning**: Essential for understanding growth patterns

#### Memory Fragmentation Ratio
- **Description**: Ratio of memory allocated by Redis vs. memory used by the OS
- **Use Case**: Identify memory fragmentation issues that can impact performance
- **Optimization**: Values significantly above 1.0 may indicate fragmentation

#### Freeable Memory
- **Description**: Amount of memory available for allocation (in bytes)
- **Use Case**: Monitor available memory before hitting limits
- **Unit**: Displayed in decimal bytes for precise capacity tracking

### Cache Performance

#### Cache Hit Rate
- **Description**: Number of successful cache lookups (cache hits)
- **Use Case**: Measure cache effectiveness and application performance
- **Optimization**: Higher hit rates indicate better cache utilization

#### Evictions
- **Description**: Number of items evicted from cache due to memory pressure
- **Use Case**: Monitor memory pressure and optimize cache policies
- **Troubleshooting**: High eviction rates may indicate insufficient memory

### Network Activity

#### Network Bytes In
- **Description**: Number of bytes received by the ElastiCache node
- **Use Case**: Monitor inbound network traffic and bandwidth utilization
- **Unit**: Displayed in decimal bytes for traffic analysis

#### Network Bytes Out
- **Description**: Number of bytes sent from the ElastiCache node
- **Use Case**: Track outbound network traffic and response data volume
- **Capacity Planning**: Essential for understanding network requirements

### Connection and System Metrics

#### Current Connections
- **Description**: Number of active client connections to the Redis instance
- **Use Case**: Monitor connection usage and identify connection leaks
- **Capacity Planning**: Track connection patterns for scaling decisions

#### Swap Usage
- **Description**: Amount of swap space used by the ElastiCache node
- **Use Case**: Identify memory pressure that forces swapping
- **Performance Impact**: High swap usage can significantly degrade performance

#### Replication Lag
- **Description**: Maximum lag time between master and replica nodes (in seconds)
- **Use Case**: Monitor replication health in Redis clusters
- **Reliability**: Essential for ensuring data consistency across replicas

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes filtering capabilities:

- **cache_cluster_id**: Filter metrics by specific ElastiCache cluster ID
  - **Multi-select**: Monitor multiple clusters simultaneously
  - **All option**: View aggregate metrics across all clusters
  - **Dynamic**: Automatically populates from available cluster IDs

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor **Cache Hit Rate** to ensure efficient cache utilization
- Track **CPU Utilization** metrics to identify processing bottlenecks
- Watch **Memory Fragmentation Ratio** for memory efficiency

### Capacity Planning
- Use **Database Memory Usage Percentage** for scaling decisions
- Monitor **Freeable Memory** to prevent out-of-memory conditions
- Track **Network Bytes** for bandwidth planning

### Troubleshooting
- High **Evictions** may indicate insufficient memory allocation
- Elevated **Swap Usage** suggests memory pressure
- Increased **Replication Lag** indicates replication issues

### Alerting Recommendations
- **CPU Utilization** > 80% - Consider scaling or optimization
- **Memory Usage** > 85% - Plan for memory scaling
- **Cache Hit Rate** < 90% - Review cache strategy
- **Replication Lag** > 5 seconds - Investigate replication health
