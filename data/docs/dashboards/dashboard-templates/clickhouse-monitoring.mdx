## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks essential ClickHouse metrics to help you:

- **Query Performance Monitoring**: Track query execution times, throughput, and failed queries
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage across ClickHouse nodes
- **Connection Management**: Track active connections, connection pool status, and session metrics
- **Replication Health**: Monitor replica lag, synchronization status, and cluster health
- **Storage Operations**: Track disk usage, merge operations, part statistics, and storage efficiency
- **System Performance**: Analyze background processes, cache performance, and system load

## Metrics Included

### Query Performance Section

#### Query Execution Metrics
- **Queries Per Second (QPS)**: Real-time query throughput showing database load
  - Grouped by query type (SELECT, INSERT, etc.) for detailed analysis
  - Essential for capacity planning and performance optimization

- **Query Execution Time**: Response time metrics including:
  - **Average Duration**: Mean query execution time
  - **P50/P90/P99 Latency**: Percentile-based latency analysis
  - Helps identify slow queries and performance bottlenecks

#### Query Status Tracking
- **Failed Query Rate**: Percentage of failed queries over time
  - Critical for identifying database issues and application problems
  - Grouped by error type for detailed troubleshooting

- **Query Types Distribution**: Breakdown of query types (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Shows workload patterns and database usage trends
  - Useful for optimizing database schema and indexes

### Resource Utilization Section

#### CPU and Memory Performance
- **CPU Utilization**: Host and ClickHouse process CPU consumption
  - Tracks both system-wide and ClickHouse-specific CPU usage
  - Essential for identifying processing bottlenecks

- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption metrics including:
  - **Total Memory Usage**: Overall memory consumption by ClickHouse
  - **Query Memory Usage**: Memory used by active queries
  - **Cache Memory**: Memory used for various ClickHouse caches

#### Storage Metrics
- **Disk Usage**: Storage consumption across ClickHouse data directories
  - Tracks data growth patterns and capacity planning needs
  - Grouped by disk and partition for detailed analysis

- **Disk I/O Operations**: Read and write operations per second
  - Monitor disk performance and identify I/O bottlenecks
  - Essential for storage optimization and capacity planning

### Connection and Session Management

#### Connection Metrics
- **Active Connections**: Current number of client connections
  - Tracks connection pool utilization and capacity
  - Important for connection limit management

- **Connection Rate**: New connections per second
  - Monitors connection establishment patterns
  - Helps identify connection leaks or unusual access patterns

#### Session Analysis
- **Active Sessions**: Currently executing queries and their duration
  - Shows concurrent query execution and resource usage
  - Critical for identifying long-running or stuck queries

### Replication and Cluster Health

#### Replication Monitoring
- **Replica Lag**: Maximum lag time between replicas
  - Tracks replication health and data consistency
  - Critical for high-availability deployments

- **Replication Queue**: Number of pending replication tasks
  - Shows replication backlog and potential issues
  - Important for maintaining cluster synchronization

#### Cluster Statistics
- **Cluster Node Status**: Health status of all cluster nodes
  - Monitors node availability and cluster integrity
  - Essential for distributed ClickHouse deployments

- **Shard Distribution**: Data distribution across cluster shards
  - Shows balance of data and query load
  - Important for cluster optimization

### Storage and Merge Operations

#### Part Management
- **Parts Count**: Number of data parts per table and partition
  - Tracks storage fragmentation and merge efficiency
  - High part counts may indicate need for merge optimization

- **Parts Size Distribution**: Size analysis of data parts
  - Shows storage efficiency and compression effectiveness
  - Useful for optimizing storage and query performance

#### Background Operations
- **Merge Operations**: Active and queued merge operations
  - Tracks background maintenance activities
  - Important for understanding storage optimization progress

- **Mutation Operations**: DDL operations and their progress
  - Monitors schema changes and data modifications
  - Critical for tracking long-running operations

## Dashboard Variables

This dashboard includes comprehensive filtering capabilities:

- **cluster**: Filter by ClickHouse cluster name for multi-cluster environments
- **database**: Select specific database for focused monitoring
- **table**: Filter metrics by specific table names
- **node**: Select individual ClickHouse nodes for node-specific analysis
- **query_type**: Filter by query types (SELECT, INSERT, etc.)
