title: Interactivity in Dashboards
---

Dashboards in SigNoz not only display charts and metrics, but also allow you to **interact with the data directly**.  
Panels created using the **Query Builder** include a context menu and click actions that let you drill deeper, apply filters, or navigate to related logs, traces, or metrics.

These interactive features make dashboards a powerful tool for root cause analysis, helping you move from high-level trends to detailed records with just a few clicks.  


## Features 

### View Logs and Traces

The **View in Logs/Traces** option allows you to go beyond aggregated charts and tables by opening the **underlying raw signal data**.  
This helps not only in viewing the exact records behind a metric or trace but also in **correlating across signals** for deeper debugging.  

#### How it works
1. Click on a datapoint in a chart or a value in a table.  
2. A context menu will appear with options including **View in Logs** and **View in Traces**.  
3. When you select one of these options:
   - The current **filters**, **time range**, and **group-by context** are preserved.  
   - SigNoz opens the corresponding **Explorer view** (Logs or Traces).  
   - You immediately see the subset of records that contributed to the clicked datapoint.  

This ensures that you can move seamlessly from **high-level aggregates** to **detailed records** without needing to rebuild queries.  

#### Example
In the example below, a **CPU Usage by Host** metrics panel shows an anomaly.  
By right-clicking on the datapoint, you can select **View in Logs** or **View in Traces** from the context menu.

    <figcaption><i>View in Logs/Traces Example</i></figcaption>
</figure>  

This workflow shortens the gap between **observing anomalies** and **finding their root cause** by connecting metrics, traces, and logs in one flow.  


### Breakout by

The **Breakout by** option allows you to **drill deeper into aggregated data** by regrouping it with another attribute.  
Instead of building a new query from scratch, you can click on a datapoint or table cell and break it down further to uncover patterns and anomalies.  

#### How it works
1. Click on a chart datapoint, bar segment, or table cell.  
2. From the context menu, select **Breakout by...**.  
3. Choose an attribute from the list (for example, `k8s.pod.name` or `host.name`).  
4. The panel is updated in place to show the new breakdown:  
   - Existing filters, time range, and dashboard variables are preserved.  
   - The **selected data is applied as a filter** so the new breakdown focuses only on that slice.  
   - The chosen attribute becomes the **new group by dimension** (it replaces the previous grouping).  

This lets you move from a broad overview to more granular insights step by step.  

#### Example
In the example below, a panel showing **CPU Usage by Host** can be further analyzed by selecting **Breakout by → k8s.pod.name**.  
This reveals which pods inside the host are contributing most to CPU usage.

</figure>  

#### Why use it
- **Anomaly detection:** Spot which service, pod, or endpoint is driving unusual behavior.  
- **Layered exploration:** Start broad (by service) and go deeper (by pod, endpoint, or trace attribute).  
- **Faster debugging:** Explore data without manually editing queries.  

### Context Links

**Context Links** are links available in a panel’s **context menu**.  
They let you attach dynamic URLs to a panel and navigate to **internal explorers** (Logs, Traces, Metrics) or **external tools** (e.g. Jenkins, PagerDuty) using the values of the data point you clicked.

    <img src="/img/docs/dashboards/interactivity/context-links-eg.png" width="80%" alt="Context Links in Menu"/>
    <figcaption><i>Context Links in Menu</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### How it works
1. Edit a panel and open the **Context Links** section.  
2. Click **+ Context Link** and configure:  
   - **Label**: The menu text (fallback is the raw URL).  
   - **URL**: A template URL with variables like `{{_service.name}}` or `{{timestamp_start}}`.  
   - **Query params**: Manage key–value pairs visually in the table. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/dashboards/interactivity/create-context-links.png" width="80%" alt="Creating a Context Link"/>
    <figcaption><i>Creating a Context Link</i></figcaption>
</figure>
 
3. The modal keeps the URL and key–value table in sync:  
   - Editing the URL auto-populates the params table (values are decoded).  
   - Editing the table updates the URL (values are encoded).  
4. In the dashboard, **click** a chart datapoint, bar segment, or table row to open the **context menu**.  
5. **Select the created link** — variables are resolved and the destination opens.  

#### Available variables
You can use different types of variables inside the URL or param values:

| Type | Description | Syntax | Example |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Time range** | Inserts the current dashboard’s absolute start and end time (epoch ms). | `{{timestamp_start}}`, `{{timestamp_end}}` | `from={{timestamp_start}}&to={{timestamp_end}}` |
| **Query variables** | The group by fields in the query the user clicks on. Available only when the panel query has a **GROUP BY**. | `{{_fieldName}}` | `{{_service.name}}`, `{{_trace_id}}` |
| **Dashboard variables** | Any dashboard-level variable defined in the dashboard settings. | `{{varName}}` | `{{host}}`, `{{env}}` |

#### Examples
**1. View trace details from a table**
```yaml
Label: View Trace Details
URL: /trace/{{_trace_id}}
```

**2. External link with variables (Jenkins / PagerDuty)**
```yaml
Label: Open in Jenkins
URL: https://jenkins.example.com/job/{{_service.name}}?from={{timestamp_start}}&to={{timestamp_end}}

Label: PagerDuty Alerts
URL: https://pagerduty.example.com/incidents?service={{_service.name}}&since={{timestamp_start}}&until={{timestamp_end}}
```

#### Why use it
- **Seamless navigation**: Jump across signals (Logs ↔ Traces ↔ Metrics) or to external tools.
- **Context preservation**: Links carry the clicked value, filters, and time range automatically.
- **Faster debugging**: One-click access to deep-dive views without rebuilding queries.

### Cross Filtering

**Cross Filtering** lets you use clicked data in a panel to update or create **dashboard variables**.  
When you click on a service, pod, or trace ID, the panel’s **context menu** includes a **Dashboard Variables** option.  
From here, the following actions are available:  

- **Set** – Assign the clicked value to an existing dashboard variable.  
- **Unset** – Remove the value from an existing dashboard variable.  
- **Create var** – Add a new **dynamic dashboard variable** using the clicked field. By default, no panels are configured to use a newly created variable, but you can configure panels later to reference it.  

If the clicked field already has a dynamic variable, you’ll see **Set/Unset**. Otherwise, the option will be **Create var**.  
Panels that use the updated variable will automatically refresh.

</figure> 

#### Why use it
- **On-the-fly filtering**: Narrow scope instantly without editing queries.
- **Dynamic exploration**: Create new variables directly from clicked data.
- **Flexible workflows**: Set, unset, or create variables depending on your analysis needs.

### Filter in Tables

The **Filter in Tables** option allows you to quickly narrow results by applying filters directly from table cells.  
Instead of editing the query manually, you can click on a group-by value in a table and add conditions on the fly.  

#### How it works
1. Open a **Table panel** with a grouped query (for example, `COUNT(*) BY service.name`).  
2. Click on a cell in a **group-by column**.

    <img src="/img/docs/dashboards/interactivity/filter-in-tables.png" width="80%" alt="Filter in Tables"/>
    <figcaption><i>Filter in Tables</i></figcaption>
</figure>


3. From the context menu, select **Filter by...**.  
4. Choose an operator based on the field type:  
   - **String**: `=` or `!=`  
   - **Number**: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  
   - **Boolean**: `is true`, `is false`  
5. Enter or confirm the filter value.  
6. The table refreshes in place with the new filter applied — no manual edits or page reloads needed.  

#### Why use it
- **Faster narrowing**: Apply filters directly from the data you are inspecting.
- **Context-aware operators**: Only valid operators for the column type are shown.
- **No query editing**: Instantly re-run the query without touching the Query Builder.
