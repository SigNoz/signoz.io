title: Monitor Snowflake in SigNoz
---

Snowflake Dashboard monitors with all the important metrics giving you a compact view showcasing 
how your Snowflake is performing.

The dashboard comes with `deployment_envrionment` and `snowflake_account_name` variables allowing you 
to monitor different deployment environments and snowflake accounts at the same place.

## Billing and Credit Usage

This section provides you with all the critical metrics about your billing and credit usage allowing 
you to see any abnormal credit usage or sudden spikes in your billing.

Some of the important metrics include overall credit used, the bifurcation of credit usage for Cloud 
Service and Virtual warehouse, as well as the breakdown of credit usage per warehouse.

This section can help you prevent getting a huge bill at the end of the month!

## Query Metrics

This is one of the important sections allowing you to check for non-performant queries, zero-in on 
the amount of data being scanned, written and deleted, and take a closer look on any sudden changes in the 
average number of rows being inserted, updated, deleted and produced.

This section will play a major role in making your Snowflake performant and identifying any bottlenecks 
due to non-optimized queries. It also helps you take calaculated decisions on scaling the warehouse size.

## Storage Metrics

This section gives a compact summary about your storage space monitoring the total storage, staged and failsafe 
bytes. It also mointors the average bytes spilled to remote and local storage.

These metrics can help you track the amount of data stored in different locations, and quickly pinpoint any drastic 
deviations in the storage patterns.
