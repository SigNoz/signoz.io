This document provides an explains how to monitor Docker container Metrics using OTel Collector and SigNoz.

## Pre-requisites

- Docker API version 1.22+
- Linux (`docker_stats` receiver does not work on Windows or Mac).

## Setup OTel Collector

OpenTelemetry Collector is required to collect metrics from Docker containers. Please refer to the [OTel Collector tutorial](/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to setup the agent.

## Collecting Docker metrics

You will need to configure [`docker_stats` OpenTelemetry receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver/README.md) for collecting Docker metrics. The receiver queries the local Docker daemon's container stats API for all desired running containers on a configured interval.

### Configuring the receiver

Edit the OTel Collector config file to configure the `docker_stats` receiver as shown below:

```yaml {2-23}
receivers:
  docker_stats:
    endpoint: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    metrics:
      container.cpu.utilization:
        enabled: true
      container.memory.percent:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.rx_bytes:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.tx_bytes:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.rx_dropped:
        enabled: true
      container.network.io.usage.tx_dropped:
        enabled: true
      container.memory.usage.limit:
        enabled: true
      container.memory.usage.total:
        enabled: true
      container.blockio.io_service_bytes_recursive:
        enabled: true
```

If you are running OTel Collector on the same machine as Docker daemon, you can remove the `endpoint` line. In case you are running OTel Collector inside a Docker container, make sure you mount the Docker socket from the host machine to the container (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`).

The receiver also supports additional parameters like `initial_delay`, `collection_interval`, `timeout` and others. For more details, refer to the [official receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver/README.md#configuration).

### Configuring the processor

To enrich the collected metrics with additional metadata like hostname and OS, you will need to configure Docker Resource Detection Processor by adding the following configuration to the OTel Collector config file:

```yaml {2-5}
processors:
  resourcedetection/docker:
    detectors: [env, docker]
    timeout: 2s
    override: false
```

### Configuring the pipelines

Once the receiver and processor is configured, make sure to also enable them in the `pipelines` section of the OTel Collector config file:

```yaml {3-4}
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [docker_stats]
      processors: [resourcedetection/docker]
```

## Sending Docker metrics to SigNoz

You will also need to configure `exporters` in the OTel Collector config file to send metrics to SigNoz. The configuration will be different based on whether you are using a SigNoz Cloud account or a Self-Hosted SigNoz instance.

### Configuring the exporter

<Tabs entityName="plans">

<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

```yaml {2-7}
exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "{signoz-ingestion-key}"
```

You would need to replace `{region}` and `{signoz-token}` in the above file with the [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/) of your SigNoz Cloud environment and [Ingestion Key ](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
</TabItem>

<TabItem value='self-host' label='Self-Host' default>

```yaml {2-5}
exporters:
   otlp:
     endpoint: "{signoz-instance}:4317"
     tls:
       insecure: true
```

You would need to replace `{signoz-instance}` with the IP address or FQDN of the machine hosting SigNoz.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Updating the pipelines

You will also need to ensure that this exporter is enabled in the `pipelines` section of the OTel Collector config file:

```yaml {5}
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [docker_stats]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

## Visualizing Docker Container Metrics

Once you have configured OTel Collector to send Docker metrics to SigNoz, you can start visualizing the metrics in the SigNoz UI.

You can use the pre-configured dashboard for Docker metrics or [create your own custom dashboard](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards/#steps-to-create-a-custom-dashboard). To use the pre-configured dashboard, download the dashboard JSON from [here](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/container-metrics/docker/container-metrics-by-host.json) and import it to SigNoz by clicking Dashboards → New dashboard → Import JSON:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/importing_dashboard.webp" width="80%" alt="Importing a pre-configured Dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>Importing a pre-configured Dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The pre-defined `Container Metrics` enables you to select the Docker host from a dropdown list and visualize the following groups of metrics:

- CPU
- Memory
- Network
- Disk

### CPU Metrics

The dashboard contains a panel that shows the percentage of CPU usage (`container_cpu_utilization`) of the containers:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/cpu_percent.webp" width="80%" alt="CPU Usage"/>
    <figcaption><i>CPU Usage Panel</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Memory Metrics

There are couple of panels related to memory. The first panel shows the percentage of memory usage (`container_memory_percent`) of the containers:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/memory_percent.webp" width="80%" alt="Memory Usage"/>
    <figcaption><i>Memory Usage Panel</i></figcaption>
</figure>

The second panel related to memory shows the memory limits (`container_memory_usage_limit`) and usage (`container_memory_usage_total`) of the containers. This is useful to understand if the containers are hitting the memory limits and might need more resources:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/memory_limits.webp" width="80%" alt="Memory Limits"/>
    <figcaption><i>Memory Limits Panel</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Network Metrics

There are two panels that display Network Bytes received and sent by the containers. The panels uses `container_network_io_usage_rx_bytes` and `container_network_io_usage_tx_bytes` metrics respectively:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/network_bytes.webp" width="80%" alt="Network Bytes"/>
    <figcaption><i>Network Bytes Panels</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally, there's a panel that shows the number of packets dropped by the containers, which uses `container_network_io_usage_rx_dropped` and `container_network_io_usage_tx_dropped` metrics:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/network_packets_dropped.webp" width="80%" alt="Network Packets Dropped"/>
    <figcaption><i>Network Packets Dropped Panels</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Disk Metrics

The dashboard also includes a "Block IO" panel based on `container.blockio.io_serviced_recursive` metric that shows the number of IOs (bio) issued to the block device per second as well as the type of IO operations (read/write):

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/metrics/docker/block_io.webp" width="80%" alt="Block IO"/>
    <figcaption><i>Block IO Panel</i></figcaption>
</figure>

You can find the full list of metrics collected by the `docker_stats` receiver and available for querying in dashboards [in the official receiver documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver/documentation.md).
