This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Celery worker applications.

## Background

Celery uses prefork worker model by [default](https://celeryproject.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/userguide/configuration.html#worker-pool). In this model, it is important to ensure that the libraries which are not fork-safe create their own instances in the parent process and each child process. To achieve this, we use `worker_process_init` hook and instantiate the OpenTelemetry SDK in each worker process. Add the following code to the app file of your Celery application.

```python
from celery.signals import worker_process_init

from opentelemetry.instrumentation.celery import CeleryInstrumentor
from opentelemetry import metrics, trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.metric_exporter import (
    OTLPMetricExporter,
)
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import (
    OTLPSpanExporter,
)
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import PeriodicExportingMetricReader
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

@worker_process_init.connect(weak=False)
def init_celery_tracing(*args, **kwargs):
    CeleryInstrumentor().instrument()

    resource = Resource.create({})

    trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider(resource=resource))
    span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
    trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

    reader = PeriodicExportingMetricReader(
        OTLPMetricExporter()
    )
    metrics.set_meter_provider(
        MeterProvider(
            resource=resource,
            metric_readers=[reader],
        )
    )
```

A brief explanation of the code above:

- Import the `worker_process_init` to connect to the Celery signal so that each worker process can initialize its own OpenTelemetry SDK.
- Import the `CeleryInstrumentor` to instrument Celery.
- Import the necessary components from the OpenTelemetry library to set up the tracer and meter providers.
- Set up the tracer and meter providers with processors and exporters.

<Admonition>

This adjustment is required only for the worker processes, not for the producer.
