{/* This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Tomcat applications.  */}
{/* OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your Tomcat application. */}
{/* 
OpenTelemetry Java is the language-specific implementation of OpenTelemetry in Java that can be used to instrument Tomcat applications.

Once the telemetry data is collected, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your Tomcat application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected. */}

{/* There are two types of application instrumentation:

- **Auto Instrumentation**<br></br>
A completely automatic and out of box experience, with minimal code changes. For your Tomcat application, we recommend getting started with auto instrumentation.

- **Manual Instrumentation**<br></br>
It involves writing instrumentation using OpenTelemetry SDK and API manually. You would need to get a handle to an instance of the `OpenTelemetry` interface, acquire a tracer, and create spans manually.

Let’s understand how to download, install, and run OpenTelemetry in a Tomcat application. */}

## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

OpenTelemetry provides a handy Java JAR agent that can be attached to any Java 8+ application and dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from a number of popular libraries and frameworks.

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

From VMs, there are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary) (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud
OpenTelemetry Java agent can send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud.
  
**Step 1.** Download otel java binary agent

```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
```

**Step 2.** Enable the instrumentation agent and run your application

If you run your `.war` package by putting in `webapps` folder, just add `setenv.sh` in your Tomcat `bin` folder.

This should set these environment variables and start sending telemetry data to SigNoz Cloud.


```bash
export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name>
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

## Send Traces to Self-Hosted SigNoz

You can use OpenTelemetry Java to send your traces directly to SigNoz. OpenTelemetry provides a **handy Java JAR agent** that can be attached to any Java 8+ application and dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from a number of popular libraries and frameworks. 

### Steps to auto-instrument Tomcat applications for traces

[OpenTelemetry Java auto-instrumentation](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/java-auto-instrumentation/) supports collecting telemetry data from a huge number of libraries and frameworks. You can check out the full list [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/supported-libraries.md).

1. **Download the latest OpenTelemetry Java JAR agent**<br></br>
   Download the latest [Java JAR agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar). You can also use the terminal to get the file using the following command:
   
   ```bash
    wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
    ```
    

2. **Enable the instrumentation agent and run your application**<br></br>
   If you run your `.war` package by putting in `webapps` folder, just add `setenv.sh` in your Tomcat `bin` folder.
   
   This should set these environment variables and start sending telemetry data to SigNoz backend specified in the IP
   
   ```bash
   export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317
   export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name>
   ```
   
   where `service_name` is the name you want to set for your application and `IP of SigNoz Backend` is the IP where SigNoz backend is accessible.

  
    
With the above environment variables, we are configuring the exporter to send data to SigNoz backend. By default, OpenTelemetry Java agent uses [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/exporters/otlp) configured to send data.<br></br>

<Admonition>
Two things to note about the environment variables:<br></br>

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - This is the endpoint of the machine where SigNoz is installed.

`path/to` -  Update it to the path of your downloaded Java JAR agent.<br></br>
</Admonition>

If you have installed SigNoz on a machine with IP `http://40.76.59.122` and your Java JAR agent is saved at `/Users/john/Downloads/`, then the final command looks like:<br></br>

```bash
export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/Users/john/Downloads/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://40.76.59.122:4317
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=Tomcat-SigNoz
```
    
Here’s a handy [grid](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/troubleshoot-instrumentation/) to figure out which address to use to send data to SigNoz.
    

<Admonition>
💡 Remember to allow incoming requests to port 4317 of the machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.

## Validating instrumentation by checking for traces

With your application running, you can verify that you’ve instrumented your application with OpenTelemetry correctly by confirming that tracing data is being reported to SigNoz.

To do this, you need to ensure that your application generates some data. Applications will not produce traces unless they are being interacted with, and OpenTelemetry will often buffer data before sending. So you need to interact with your application and wait for some time to see your tracing data in SigNoz.

Validate your traces in SigNoz:

1. Trigger an action in your app that generates a web request. Hit the endpoint a number of times to generate some data. Then, wait for some time.
2. In SigNoz, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`.
3. Go to the `Traces` tab, and apply relevant filters to see your application’s traces.

{/* You might see other dummy applications if you’re using SigNoz for the first time. You can remove it by following the docs [here](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application). */}

    <figcaption><i>Java Application in the list of services being monitored in SigNoz</i></figcaption>
    </figure> */}


### Configuring the agent

The agent is highly configurable. You can check out all the configuration options available [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/).

## Disabled instrumentations

Some instrumentations can produce too many spans and make traces very noisy. For this reason, the following instrumentations are disabled by default:

- `jdbc-datasource` which creates spans whenever the `java.sql.DataSource#getConnection` method is called.
- `dropwizard-metrics`, which might create very low-quality metrics data because of the lack of label/attribute support in the Dropwizard metrics API.

To enable them, add the `otel.instrumentation.<name>.enabled` system property: `-Dotel.instrumentation.jdbc-datasource.enabled=true`

## Manual Instrumentation

For manual instrumentation of Java application, refer to the docs [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/manual/).

{/* 
<!-- Get up and running with OpenTelemetry in just a few quick steps! The setup process consists of two phases--getting OpenTelemetry installed and configured, and then validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected. This guide explains how to download, install, and run OpenTelemetry in Java.

We follow [OpenTelemetry java instrumentation library](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). **We shall be exporting data in OTLP format.**

### Getting Started

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar).

This package includes the instrumentation agent as well as instrumentations for all supported libraries and all available data exporters. The package provides a completely automatic, out-of-the-box experience.

Enable the instrumentation agent using the -javaagent flag to the JVM.



### For Java applications packaged as JAR files

If you run your Java application as a JAR file, please follow the below instruction


```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317" OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<app_name> java -javaagent:/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar  <myapp>.jar
```

where <app_name> is the name you want to set for your application. `path` should be updated to the path of downloaded Java JAR agent.

You can also specify environment variables in the following way

```bash
java -javaagent:/path/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
    -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317 \
    -Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=<app_name> \
    -jar <myapp>.jar
```

## Troubleshooting your installation

If spans are not being reported to SigNoz, try running in debug mode by setting `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug`:

The debug log level will print out the configuration information. It will also emit every span to the console, which should look something like:

```bash
Span {
  attributes: {},
  links: [],
  events: [],
  status: { code: 0 },
  endTime: [ 1597810686, 885498645 ],
  _ended: true,
  _duration: [ 0, 43333 ],
  name: 'bar',
  spanContext: {
    traceId: 'eca3cc297720bd705e734f4941bca45a',
    spanId: '891016e5f8c134ad',
    traceFlags: 1,
    traceState: undefined
  },
  parentSpanId: 'cff3a2c6bfd4bbef',
  kind: 0,
  startTime: [ 1597810686, 885455312 ],
  resource: Resource { labels: [Object] },
  instrumentationLibrary: { name: 'example', version: '*' },
  _logger: ConsoleLogger {
    debug: [Function],
    info: [Function],
    warn: [Function],
    error: [Function]
  },
  _traceParams: {
    numberOfAttributesPerSpan: 32,
    numberOfLinksPerSpan: 32,
    numberOfEventsPerSpan: 128
  },
  _spanProcessor: MultiSpanProcessor { _spanProcessors: [Array] }
},
```
