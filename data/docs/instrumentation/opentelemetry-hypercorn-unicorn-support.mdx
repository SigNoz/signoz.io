The OpenTelemetry SDK is not fork-safe, meaning you cannot use the same instance of the SDK in multiple processes. Specifically, the `BatchSpanProcessor`, `PeriodicExportingMetricReader`, and `BatchLogProcessor` must not be copied from a parent process to a child process. Instead, the parent process and child process must create their own instances. If instances of these processors/readers are copied from a parent to a child process, they will not function correctly.

These components spawn background threads to send data to the backend and maintain state protected by a lock, which is not fork-safe (see Python issue [6721](https://bugs.python.org/issue6721)). As a result, they face the same limitations as any code using locks or mutexes.

A common workaround is to create new instances of these processors/readers in each process using the `register_at_fork` hook from the `os` module. However, Unicorn/Hypercorn use the `spawn` method to start worker processes, which does not invoke the `register_at_fork` hook. Consequently, this workaround is not applicable to Unicorn/Hypercorn.

The recommended solution is to use [`gunicorn`](https://docs.gunicorn.org/) with the worker class `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker` since it supports the `register_at_fork` hook.
