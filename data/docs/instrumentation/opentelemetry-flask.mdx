## Send Traces to SigNoz Cloud

{/* <YouTube id="50t8T2iL6sA" mute={false} /> */}

Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>

From VMs, there are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary) (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud

**Step 1.** Create a virtual environment<br></br>
    
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 2.** Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
```

The dependencies included are briefly explained below:

`opentelemetry-distro` - The distro provides a mechanism to automatically configure some of the more common options for users. It helps to get started with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation quickly. 

`opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` - This library provides a way to install all OTLP exporters. You will need an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

<Admonition>
ðŸ’¡ TheÂ `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`Â is a convenience wrapper package to install all OTLP exporters. Currently, it installs:

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc

- (soon) opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http

The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` package installs the gRPC exporter which depends on the `grpcio` package. The installation of `grpcio` may fail on some platforms for various reasons. If you run into such issues, or you don't want to use gRPC, you can install the HTTP exporter instead by installing the `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` package. You need to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable to `http/protobuf` to use the HTTP exporter.
</Admonition>

**Step 3.** Add automatic instrumentation

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

<Admonition>
Please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of your application before running the above command. The command will not install instrumentation for the dependencies which are not installed.
</Admonition>

**Step 4.** Run your application

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
opentelemetry-instrument <your_run_command>
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

<Admonition>
Donâ€™t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `export Flask_ENV=development`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
</Admonition>

**Step 5.** Validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

**Step 1.** Install OTel Collector binary<br></br>

OTel Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes.

You can find instructions to install OTel Collector binary [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) in your VM.

**Step 2.** Create a virtual environment<br></br>
    
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 3.** Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
```

The dependencies included are briefly explained below:

`opentelemetry-distro` - The distro provides a mechanism to automatically configure some of the more common options for users. It helps to get started with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation quickly.

OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument <your run command>
```

<Admonition>
Donâ€™t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `export Flask_ENV=development`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
</Admonition>

*`<service_name>`*Â is the name of service you want

*`<your_run_command>`*Â can beÂ `python3 app.py`Â orÂ `flask run`

*`http://localhost:4317`* for gRPC exporter and `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP exporter.

<Admonition>
The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively.
</Admonition>

In case you have OtelCollector Agent in different VM, replace localhost:4317 with `<IP Address of the VM>:4317`.

**Step 6.** You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

You can auto-instrument sending traces from the Flask application using one of the following methods:

1. Using Kubernetes OTel Operator (recommended)
2. Using OTel Collector Agent

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="k8s-otel-operator" label="K8s OTel Operator" default>
### K8s OTel Operator Based Automatic Instrumentation (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud - Using K8s OTel Operator

For Python Flask application deployed on Kubernetes, you can auto-instrument the traces using Kubernetes OpenTelemetry Operator. 

An [OpenTelemetry Operator](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator) is a Kubernetes Operator that manages 
[OpenTelemetry Collectors](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/) and auto-instrumentation of 
workloads. It basically simplifies the deployment and management of OpenTelemetry in a Kubernetes environment.

The OpenTelemetry Operator provides two Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

- `OpenTelemetryCollector`
- `Instrumentation`

The `OpenTelemetryCollector` CRD allows you to deploy and manage OpenTelemetry Collectors in your Kubernetes cluster.

The `Instrumentation` CRD allows you to configure and inject OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries into your workloads.

Here are the steps you need to follow to auto-instrument Flask application using OTel Operator:

**Step 1.** Install cert-manager

Run the following commands to apply cert manager.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.1/cert-manager.yaml

kubectl wait --for=condition=Available deployments/cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

**Step 2.** Install OpenTelemetry Operator

To install the operator in the existing K8s cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/releases/download/v0.116.0/opentelemetry-operator.yaml
```

Installing the OpenTelemetry Operator sets up the necessary components and configurations to enable the observability and monitoring of applications running in the cluster.

**Step 3.** Setup the OpenTelemetry Collector instance

Once the `opentelemetry-operator` has been deployed, you can proceed with the creation of the OpenTelemetry Collector (`otelcol`) instance. The OpenTelemetry Collector collects, processes, and exports telemetry data.

There are different deployment modes for the `OpenTelemetryCollector`, and you can specify them in the spec.mode section of the custom resource. The available deployment modes are:

- [Daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)
- [Sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/)
- [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
- [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) (default mode)

The default method - the `Deployment` mode, will be used here.

To create a simple instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector, create a file `otel-collector.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml:otel-collector.yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
spec:
  mode: deployment
  config: |
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
    processors:
      batch: {}
      resource/env:
        attributes:
        - key: deployment.environment
          value: prod # can be dev, prod, staging etc. based on your environment
          action: upsert
    exporters:
      debug: {}
      otlp:
        endpoint: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" # replace <region> with your region of SigNoz Cloud
        tls:
          insecure: false
        headers:
          "signoz-ingestion-key": "<your-ingestion-key>" # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-tenant-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch, resource/env]
          exporters: [otlp]
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)

Apply the above yaml file using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml
```

**Step 4.** Setup the Instrumentation instance

Once the OpenTelemetry Collector instance has been deployed, the next step will be to create an instrumentation instance, which will be responsible for sending OTLP data to the OTel Collector.

Create a file `instrumentation.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml:instrumentation.yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: traces-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443  # replace <region> with your region of SigNoz Cloud
  env:
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
      value: signoz-ingestion-key="<signoz-token>"  # Obtain from https://{your-signoz-url}/settings/ingestion-settings
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE
      value: "false"
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
    - b3
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_traceidratio
    argument: "1"
  python:
    image: ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/autoinstrumentation-python:latest
    env:
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://otel-collector-collector:4318 #This is formed as: "http://<OpenTelemetryCollector name>-collector:4318"
```

Apply the above instrumentation using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f instrumentation.yaml
```

**Step 5.** Auto-instrument your Flask app with OpenTelemetry

Create `deployment.yaml` file for your Flask application as follows:

```yaml:deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-app
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-app
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-app
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: "true"
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/otel-python-platform: "musl"
        resource.opentelemetry.io/service.name: "flask-app"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: flask-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

It is important to add the following annotation under `spec > template > metadata > annotations`:

```
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: "true"
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/otel-python-platform: "musl" # "musl" for Linux musl based images or "glibc" for Linux glibc based images
```

This helps in auto-instrumenting the traces from the Flask application.

Apply the deployment using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

With this, the auto-instrumentation of traces for Flask application is ready.

**Step 6.** Running the Flask application

In order to run the application on port 8080, run the following commands:

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app=<service-name> -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")  # service name is `flask-app` in this case.   

kubectl port-forward ${POD_NAME} 8080:8080
```

You can now access the application on port 8080.

You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="otel-collector-agent" label="OTel Collector Agent">
For Python Flask application deployed on Kubernetes, you need to install OTel Collector agent in your k8s infra to collect and send traces to SigNoz Cloud. You can find the instructions to install OTel Collector agent [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/).

Once you have set up OTel Collector agent, you can proceed with OpenTelemetry Python instrumentation by following the below steps:

**Step 1.** Create a virtual environment<br></br>
    
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 2.** Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
```

The dependencies included are briefly explained below:

`opentelemetry-distro` - The distro provides a mechanism to automatically configure some of the more common options for users. It helps to get started with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation quickly.

<Admonition>
The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively.
</Admonition>

In case you have OtelCollector Agent in different VM, replace localhost:4317 with `<IP Address of the VM>:4317`.

**Step 5.** Make sure to dockerise your application along with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

There are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud. You can containerize the images in both the cases.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud-1)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary-1) (recommended)

#### Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud

**Step 1.** Configure OpenTelemetry to run in Docker Container

Add the following in your Dockerfile.

```bash
...

# install dependencies
RUN pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0 opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0

...

# NOTE: ADD THIS AFTER pip install requirements.txt
RUN opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install

...

# Set environment variables for OpenTelemetry
ENV OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service-name>
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<your-ingestion-key>
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc

# Replace with your run command
CMD ["opentelemetry-instrument", <run_command>]
```

- Replace `<run_command>` with the command to run your application
- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

The above steps install OpenTelemetry dependencies directly inside the Docker container without altering `requirements.txt` file of project & sets environment variables to export the traces.

**Step 2.** Run your Docker container

Here's how you can run your docker container:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> . && docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
```

- Replace `<image-name>`, `<host-port>`, and `<container-port>` with values for your application.

- `-d` runs the container in detached mode
- `-p` maps a host port to a container port


**Step 3.** Validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud by following the instructions [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-signoz-installation).

#### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

**Step 1.** Configure OpenTelemetry to run in Docker Container

Add the following in your Dockerfile.

```bash
# install OpenTelemetry Collector in Docker container
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.131.0 AS otel

COPY --from=otel /otelcol-contrib /otelcol-contrib
COPY --from=otel /etc/otelcol-contrib /etc/otelcol-contrib

COPY config.yaml /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml

...

# And install OpenTelemetry packages
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0 opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0

...

# add this right after installing your dependencies
RUN opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install

# Replace APP_PORT with the port of your application
EXPOSE 4317 4318 <APP_PORT>

# Set environment variables for OpenTelemetry
ENV OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service-name>
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
ENV OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc

# Run app.py with OpenTelemetry instrumentation when the container launches
CMD sh -c "/otelcol-contrib --config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml & opentelemetry-instrument <run_command>
...
```

Make sure you have `config.yaml` in `root` of the application. This config.yaml should be copied from third step of [this](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/docker/install/#step-2-create-collector-configuration)

- Replace `<run_command>` with the command to run your application
- `<service_name>` is name of your service


**Step 2.** Run your Docker container

Run your docker container to start exporting.

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> . && docker run -d -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
```

- Replace `<image-name>`, `<host-port>`, and `<container-port>` with values for your application.

- `-d` runs the container in detached mode

- `-p` maps a host port to a container port

## Send Traces to Self-Hosted SigNoz

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your Flask application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

{/* <figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/docs/otel_python_instrumentation.webp" alt="OpenTelemetry helps to generate and collect telemetry data from your application which is then sent to an observability backend like SigNoz"/>
    <figcaption><i>OpenTelemetry helps generate and collect telemetry data from Python applications which can then be sent to SigNoz for storage, visualization, and analysis.</i></figcaption>
</figure> */}


Letâ€™s understand how to download, install, and run OpenTelemetry in Flask.

You can use OpenTelemetry to send your traces directly to SigNoz. OpenTelemetry provides a handy distro in Python that can help you get started with automatic instrumentation. We recommend using it to get started quickly.

### Steps to auto-instrument Flask app for traces

1. **Create a virtual environment**<br></br>
    
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
2. **Install the OpenTelemetry dependencies**<br></br>
    
    ```bash
    pip install opentelemetry-distro==0.43b0
    pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp==1.22.0
    ```
    
    The dependencies included are briefly explained below:

    `opentelemetry-distro` - The distro provides a mechanism to automatically configure some of the more common options for users. It helps to get started with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation quickly. 
    
    `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` - This library provides a way to install all OTLP exporters. You will need an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

    <Admonition>
    ðŸ’¡ TheÂ `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`Â is a convenience wrapper package to install all OTLP exporters. Currently, it installs:
    
    - opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
    - opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc

    - (soon) opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http
    
    The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` package installs the gRPC exporter which depends on the `grpcio` package. The installation of `grpcio` may fail on some platforms for various reasons. If you run into such issues, or you don't want to use gRPC, you can install the HTTP exporter instead by installing the `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` package. You need to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable to `http/protobuf` to use the HTTP exporter.
    </Admonition>
    
3. **Add automatic instrumentation**<br></br>
     The below command inspects the dependencies of your application and installs the instrumentation packages relevant for your Flask application.
    
    ```bash
    opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
    ```

    <Admonition>
     Please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of your application before running the above command. The command will not install instrumentation for the dependencies which are not installed.
    </Admonition>

4. **Run your application**<br></br>
     In the final run command, you can configure environment variables and flags. Flags for exporters:<br></br>
     
     For running your application, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. Below are the notes:
    <Admonition>
     Donâ€™t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `export Flask_ENV=development`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
    </Admonition>

    
    For running applications with application servers which are based on [pre fork model](#running-applications-with-gunicorn-uwsgi), like Gunicorn, uWSGI you have to add a post_fork hook or a @postfork decorator in your configuration.
     
     To start sending data to SigNoz, use the following run command:

     ```bash
     OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument <your run command>
     ```

     *`<service_name>`*Â is the name of service you want

     *`<your_run_command>`*Â can beÂ `python3 app.py`Â orÂ `flask run`

     `IP of SigNoz backend` is the IP of the machine where you installed SigNoz. If you have installed SigNoz on `localhost`, the endpoint will be `http://localhost:4317` for gRPC exporter and `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP exporter.

    <Admonition>
     The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively. Remember to allow incoming requests to portÂ **4317**/**4318**Â of machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.

    In case you encounter an issue where all applications do not get listed in the services section then please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-your-installation).

## Validating instrumentation by checking for traces

With your application running, you can verify that youâ€™ve instrumented your application with OpenTelemetry correctly by confirming that tracing data is being reported to SigNoz.

To do this, you need to ensure that your application generates some data. Applications will not produce traces unless they are being interacted with, and OpenTelemetry will often buffer data before sending. So you need to interact with your application and wait for some time to see your tracing data in SigNoz.

Validate your traces in SigNoz:

1. Trigger an action in your app that generates a web request. Hit the endpoint a number of times to generate some data. Then, wait for some time.
2. In SigNoz, open theÂ `Services`Â tab. Hit theÂ `Refresh`Â button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list ofÂ `Applications`.
3. Go to theÂ `Traces`Â tab, and apply relevant filters to see your applicationâ€™s traces.

{/* You might see other dummy applications if youâ€™re using SigNoz for the first time. You can remove it by following the docsÂ [here](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application). */}

{/* ## Database Instrumentation

Make sure that the DB client library you are using has the corresponding instrumentation library, and the version of the DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry.

### MongoDB Database Instrumentation

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your MongoDB database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For MongoDB, the instrumentation library is `opentelemetry-instrumentation-pymongo`.

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

### Redis Database Instrumentation

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your Redis database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For Redis, the instrumentation library is `opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis`.

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

### MySQL Database Instrumentation

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your MySQL database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For MySQL, we have two isntrumentation libraries:

- opentelemetry-instrumentation-mysql
- opentelemetry-instrumentation-pymysql

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

### Postgres Database Instrumentation

You can use  `opentelemetry-distro` to initialize instrumentation for your PostgreSQL database calls. You need to ensure that the version of your DB client library is supported by OpenTelemetry. For Postgres, the instrumentation library is `opentelemetry-instrumentation-psycopg2`.

You can check the supported versions [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

<Admonition>

`psycopg2-binary` is not supported by opentelemetry auto instrumentation libraries as it is not recommended for production use. Please use `psycopg2` to see DB calls also in your trace data in SigNoz

</Admonition>

## Running applications with Gunicorn, uWSGI

For application servers which are based on pre fork model like Gunicorn, uWSGI you have to add a `post_fork` hook or a `@postfork` decorator in your configuration.

Check this [documentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fork-process-model/README.html) from OpenTelemetry on how to set it up.

Here's a [working example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/tree/main/docs/examples/fork-process-model) where we have configured a gunicorn server with `post_fork` hook.
  



## Troubleshooting your installation

#### Spans are not being reported

If spans are not being reported to SigNoz, try enabling debug exporter which writes the JSON formatted trace data to the console by setting env var OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console.

```
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=python_app OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console opentelemetry-instrument <your run command>
```


```json
