This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your Rust applications and view your application traces in SigNoz.

{/* This doc contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry(OTel) instrumentation in your Rust application. */}
{/* OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open-source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your Rust application. */}
{/* 
Once the telemetry data is generated, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz for monitoring and visualization.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your Rust application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring the exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating that configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

In this tutorial, we will instrument a Rust application for traces and send it to SigNoz. */}

## Send traces to SigNoz Cloud
Based on your application environment, you can choose the setup below to send traces to SigNoz Cloud.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vm" label="VM" default>
From VMs, there are two ways to send data to SigNoz Cloud.

- [Send traces directly to SigNoz Cloud](#send-traces-directly-to-signoz-cloud)
- [Send traces via OTel Collector binary](#send-traces-via-otel-collector-binary) (recommended)

### Send traces directly to SigNoz cloud

{/* Here we will be sending traces to SigNoz cloud in 4 easy steps, if you want to send traces to self hosted SigNoz , you can refer to [this](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/rust/#send-traces-to-self-hosted-signoz). 

<Admonition type="info">
If you are using the [sample Rust application](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-rust-app), then you just need to update .env file and you are good to go!
</Admonition> */}

**Step 1 : Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your Rust application to send data we need to initialize OpenTelemetry, OTel has already created some crates which you need to add into your `Cargo.toml` file, just below `[dependencies]` section.

```
opentelemetry = { version = "0.18.0", features = ["rt-tokio", "metrics", "trace"] }
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["trace", "metrics"] }
opentelemetry-semantic-conventions = { version = "0.10.0" }
opentelemetry-proto = { version = "0.1.0"}
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tonic = { version = "0.8.2", features = ["tls-roots"] }
```
after adding these in `Cargo.toml` , you need to use these in entry point of your Rust application , which is `main.rs` file in majority of applications. 

```rust
use opentelemetry::global::shutdown_tracer_provider;
use opentelemetry::sdk::Resource;
use opentelemetry::trace::TraceError;
use opentelemetry::{
    global, sdk::trace as sdktrace,
    trace::{TraceContextExt, Tracer},
    Context, Key, KeyValue,
};
use opentelemetry_otlp::WithExportConfig;
use tonic::metadata::{MetadataMap, MetadataValue};
```

**Step 2: Initialize the tracer and create env file**

Add this function in main.rs file, `init_tracer` is initializing an OpenTelemetry tracer with the OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter which is sending data to SigNoz Cloud. 

```rust
fn init_tracer() -> Result<sdktrace::Tracer, TraceError> {
    let SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY = std::env::var("SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY").expect("SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY not set");
    let mut metadata = MetadataMap::new();
    metadata.insert(
        "signoz-ingestion-key",
        MetadataValue::from_str(&SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY).unwrap(),
    );
    opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .tracing()
        .with_exporter(
            opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter()
                .tonic()
                .with_metadata(metadata)
                .with_endpoint(std::env::var("SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT").expect("SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT not set")),
        )
        .with_trace_config(
            sdktrace::config().with_resource(Resource::new(vec![
                KeyValue::new(
                    opentelemetry_semantic_conventions::resource::SERVICE_NAME,
                    std::env::var("APP_NAME").expect("APP_NAME not set"),
                ),
            ])),
        )
        .install_batch(opentelemetry::runtime::Tokio)
}
```

After adding this function, you need to create a `.env` file in root of project , the structure should look like this.
```
project_root/
|-- Cargo.toml
|-- src/
|   |-- main.rs
|-- .env
```

Paste these in `.env` file 
```bash
PORT=3000
APP_NAME=<service_name>
SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
SIGNOZ_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-ingestion-key>
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service
- PORT (Optional) - If it is a web app pass port or else you can ignore this variable

**Step 3: Add the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for your Rust app**

Open your Cargo.toml file and paste these below `[dependencies]`
```
dotenv = "0.15.0"
```

Import these at top, so you can use variables from `.env` file
```rust
use dotenv::dotenv;
```

After importing , just call these functions inside `main()` function by pasting this at starting of `main()` function
```rust 
dotenv().ok();
let _ = init_tracer();
```

also change
```rust
fn main(){
    //rest of the code
}
```
to 
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    //rest of the code
}
```

Now comes the most interesting part, Sending data to SigNoz to get sense of your traces. After adding the below block you can send data to SigNoz cloud

```rust
  let tracer = global::tracer("global_tracer");
    let _cx = Context::new();
  
    tracer.in_span("operation", |cx| {
        let span = cx.span();
        span.set_attribute(Key::new("KEY").string("value"));

        span.add_event(
            format!("Operations"),
            vec![
                Key::new("SigNoz is").string("Awesome"),
            ],
        );
    });
    shutdown_tracer_provider()
```

**Step 4: Set environment variables and run app**

Go to your `.env` file and update the value of required variables i.e
`APP_NAME`,
`SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT` and
`SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY`

Now run `cargo run` in terminal to start the application!

### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

**Step 1. Install OTel Collector binary**

OTel Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes.

You can find instructions to install OTel Collector binary [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) in your VM.

**Step 2 : Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your Rust application to send traces we need to initialize OpenTelemetry, OTel has already created some crates which you need to add into your `Cargo.toml` file, just below `[dependencies]` section.

```
opentelemetry = { version = "0.18.0", features = ["rt-tokio", "metrics", "trace"] }
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["trace", "metrics"] }
opentelemetry-semantic-conventions = { version = "0.10.0" }
opentelemetry-proto = { version = "0.1.0"}
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tonic = { version = "0.8.2", features = ["tls-roots"] }
```
after adding these in `Cargo.toml` , you need to use these in entry point of your Rust application , which is `main.rs` file in majority of applications. 

```rust
use opentelemetry::global::shutdown_tracer_provider;
use opentelemetry::sdk::Resource;
use opentelemetry::trace::TraceError;
use opentelemetry::{
    global, sdk::trace as sdktrace,
    trace::{TraceContextExt, Tracer},
    Context, Key, KeyValue,
};
use opentelemetry_otlp::WithExportConfig;
use tonic::metadata::{MetadataMap, MetadataValue};
```

**Step 3: Initialize the tracer and create env file**

Add this function in main.rs file, `init_tracer` is initializing an OpenTelemetry tracer with the OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter which is sending data to SigNoz Cloud. 

This tracer initializes the connection with the OTel collector from the system variables passed while starting the app. 

```rust
fn init_tracer() -> Result<sdktrace::Tracer, TraceError> {
    opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .tracing()
        .with_exporter(opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter().tonic().with_env())
        .with_trace_config(
            sdktrace::config().with_resource(Resource::default()),
        )
        .install_batch(opentelemetry::runtime::Tokio)
}
```

**Step 4: Add the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for your Rust app**

You need call init_tracer function inside `main()` at starting so that as soon as your rust application starts, tracer will be available globally.
```rust 
let _ = init_tracer();
```

also change
```rust
fn main(){
    //rest of the code
}
```
to 
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    //rest of the code
}
```

Now comes the most interesting part, Sending data to SigNoz to get sense of your traces. After adding the below block you can send traces to SigNoz cloud

```rust
  let tracer = global::tracer("global_tracer");
    let _cx = Context::new();
  
    tracer.in_span("operation", |cx| {
        let span = cx.span();
        span.set_attribute(Key::new("KEY").string("value"));

        span.add_event(
            format!("Operations"),
            vec![
                Key::new("SigNoz is").string("Awesome"),
            ],
        );
    });
    shutdown_tracer_provider()
```

**Step 5: Set environment variables and run app**


| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT     | This is the endpoint of your OTel Collector. If you have hosted it somewhere, provide the URL. Otherwise, the default is `http://localhost:4317` if you have followed our guide. |
| OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name        | Specify  as the value. This will be the name of your Rust application on SigNoz services page, allowing you to uniquely identify the application traces.        |


Now run 
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=sample-rust-app cargo run
```
in terminal to start the application!

<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

**Step 1 : Install OTel Collector agent in K8s**

For Rust application deployed on Kubernetes, you need to install OTel Collector agent in your k8s infra to collect and send traces to SigNoz Cloud. You can find the instructions to install OTel Collector agent [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

        span.set_attribute(Key::new("KEY").string("value"));

        span.add_event(
            format!("Operations"),
            vec![
                Key::new("SigNoz is").string("Awesome"),
            ],

opentelemetry-proto = { version = "0.1.0"}
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tonic = { version = "0.8.2", features = ["tls-roots"] }
```
after adding these in `Cargo.toml` , you need to use these in entry point of your Rust application , which is `main.rs` file in majority of applications. 

```rust
use opentelemetry::global::shutdown_tracer_provider;
use opentelemetry::sdk::Resource;

```

**Step 2: Initialize the tracer and create env file**

Add this function in main.rs file, `init_tracer` is initializing an OpenTelemetry tracer with the OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter which is sending data to SigNoz Cloud. 

```rust
fn init_tracer() -> Result<sdktrace::Tracer, TraceError> {
    let SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY = std::env::var("SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY").expect("SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY not set");
    let mut metadata = MetadataMap::new();
    metadata.insert(
        "signoz-ingestion-key",
        MetadataValue::from_str(&SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY).unwrap(),
    );
    opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .tracing()
        .with_exporter(
            opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter()
                .tonic()

            ])),
        )
        .install_batch(opentelemetry::runtime::Tokio)
}
```

After adding this function, you need to create a `.env` file in root of project , the structure should look like this.
```
project_root/
|-- Cargo.toml
|-- src/
|   |-- main.rs
|-- .env
```

Paste these in `.env` file 
```bash
PORT=3000
APP_NAME=<service_name>
SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT=https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces
SIGNOZ_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXX
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service
- PORT (Optional) - If it is a web app pass port or else you can ignore this variable

**Step 3: Add the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for your Rust app**

Open your Cargo.toml file and paste these below `[dependencies]`
```
dotenv = "0.15.0"
```

Import these at top, so you can use variables from `.env` file
```rust
use dotenv::dotenv;
```

After importing , just call these functions inside `main()` function by pasting this at starting of `main()` function
```rust 
dotenv().ok();
let _ = init_tracer();
```

also change
```rust
fn main(){
    //rest of the code
}
```
to 
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    //rest of the code
}
```

Now comes the most interesting part, Sending data to SigNoz to get sense of your traces. After adding the below block you can send data to SigNoz cloud

```rust
  let tracer = global::tracer("global_tracer");
    let _cx = Context::new();
  
    tracer.in_span("operation", |cx| {
        let span = cx.span();
        span.set_attribute(Key::new("KEY").string("value"));

        span.add_event(
            format!("Operations"),
            vec![
                Key::new("SigNoz is").string("Awesome"),
            ],
        );
    });
    shutdown_tracer_provider()
```

**Step 4: Set environment variables and run app**

Go to your `.env` file and update the value of required variables i.e
`APP_NAME`,
`SIGNOZ_ENDPOINT` and
`SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY`

Now run `cargo run` in terminal to start the application!

### Send traces via OTel Collector binary

**Step 1 : Install OTel Collector binary**

OTel Collector binary helps to collect logs, hostmetrics, resource and infra attributes.

You can find instructions to install OTel Collector binary [here](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) in your VM.

**Step 2 : Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your Rust application to send traces we need to initialize OpenTelemetry, OTel has already created some crates which you need to add into your `Cargo.toml` file, just below `[dependencies]` section.

```
opentelemetry = { version = "0.18.0", features = ["rt-tokio", "metrics", "trace"] }
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["trace", "metrics"] }
opentelemetry-semantic-conventions = { version = "0.10.0" }
opentelemetry-proto = { version = "0.1.0"}
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tonic = { version = "0.8.2", features = ["tls-roots"] }
```
after adding these in `Cargo.toml` , you need to use these in entry point of your Rust application , which is `main.rs` file in majority of applications. 

```rust
use opentelemetry::global::shutdown_tracer_provider;
use opentelemetry::sdk::Resource;
use opentelemetry::trace::TraceError;
use opentelemetry::{
    global, sdk::trace as sdktrace,
    trace::{TraceContextExt, Tracer},
    Context, Key, KeyValue,
};
use opentelemetry_otlp::WithExportConfig;
use tonic::metadata::{MetadataMap, MetadataValue};
```

**Step 3: Initialize the tracer and create env file**

Add this function in main.rs file, `init_tracer` is initializing an OpenTelemetry tracer with the OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter which is sending data to SigNoz Cloud. 

This tracer initializes the connection with the OTel collector from the system variables passed while starting the app. 

```rust
fn init_tracer() -> Result<sdktrace::Tracer, TraceError> {
    opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .tracing()
        .with_exporter(
            opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter()
                .tonic()
                .with_endpoint(std::env::var("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT").expect("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT not set")),
        )
        .with_trace_config(
            sdktrace::config().with_resource(Resource::new(vec![
                KeyValue::new(
                    opentelemetry_semantic_conventions::resource::SERVICE_NAME,
                    std::env::var("APP_NAME").expect("APP_NAME not set"),
                ),
            ])),
        )
        .install_batch(opentelemetry::runtime::Tokio)
}
```

**Step 4: Add the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for your Rust app**

You need call init_tracer function inside `main()` at starting so that as soon as your rust application starts, tracer will be available globally.
```rust 
let _ = init_tracer();
```

also change
```rust
fn main(){
    //rest of the code
}
```
to 
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    //rest of the code
}
```

Now comes the most interesting part, Sending data to SigNoz to get sense of your traces. After adding the below block you can send traces to SigNoz cloud

```rust
  let tracer = global::tracer("global_tracer");
    let _cx = Context::new();
  
    tracer.in_span("operation", |cx| {
        let span = cx.span();
        span.set_attribute(Key::new("KEY").string("value"));

        span.add_event(
            format!("Operations"),
            vec![
                Key::new("SigNoz is").string("Awesome"),
            ],
        );
    });
    shutdown_tracer_provider()
```

**Step 5: Set environment variables and run app**

Create a `.env` file in root of project , the structure should look like this.
```
project_root/
|-- Cargo.toml
|-- src/
|   |-- main.rs
|-- .env
```

Paste these in `.env` file 
```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<otel_collector_endpoint>
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=<service_name>
```


| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT     | This is the endpoint of your OTel Collector. If you have hosted it somewhere, provide the URL. Otherwise, the default is `http://localhost:4317` if you have followed our guide. |
| OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name        | Specify  as the value. This will be the name of your Rust application on SigNoz services page, allowing you to uniquely identify the application traces.        |


Now run 
```
cargo run
```
in terminal to start the application!

## Send Traces to Self-Hosted SigNoz

**Step 1 : Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your Rust application to send traces we need to initialize OpenTelemetry, OTel has already created some crates which you need to add into your `Cargo.toml` file, just below `[dependencies]` section.

```
opentelemetry = { version = "0.18.0", features = ["rt-tokio", "metrics", "trace"] }
opentelemetry-otlp = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["trace", "metrics"] }
opentelemetry-semantic-conventions = { version = "0.10.0" }
opentelemetry-proto = { version = "0.1.0"}
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tonic = { version = "0.8.2", features = ["tls-roots"] }
```
after adding these in `Cargo.toml` , you need to use these in entry point of your Rust application , which is `main.rs` file in majority of applications. 

```rust
use opentelemetry::global::shutdown_tracer_provider;
use opentelemetry::sdk::Resource;
use opentelemetry::trace::TraceError;
use opentelemetry::{
    global, sdk::trace as sdktrace,
    trace::{TraceContextExt, Tracer},
    Context, Key, KeyValue,
};
use opentelemetry_otlp::WithExportConfig;
use tonic::metadata::{MetadataMap, MetadataValue};
```

**Step 2: Initialize the tracer and create env file**

Add this function in main.rs file, `init_tracer` is initializing an OpenTelemetry tracer with the OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter which is sending data to your Self-Hosted SigNoz. 

```rust
fn init_tracer() -> Result<sdktrace::Tracer, TraceError> {
    opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .tracing()
        .with_exporter(opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter().tonic().with_env())
        .with_trace_config(
            sdktrace::config().with_resource(Resource::default()),
        )
        .install_batch(opentelemetry::runtime::Tokio)
}
```

**Step 3: Add the OpenTelemetry instrumentation for your Rust app**

You need call init_tracer function inside `main()` at starting so that as soon as your rust application starts, tracer will be available globally.
```rust 
let _ = init_tracer();
```

also change
```rust
fn main(){
    //rest of the code
}
```
to 
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    //rest of the code
}
```

Now comes the most interesting part, Sending data to SigNoz to get sense of your traces. After adding the below block you can send traces to Self-Hosted SigNoz

```rust
  let tracer = global::tracer("global_tracer");
    let _cx = Context::new();
  
    tracer.in_span("operation", |cx| {
        let span = cx.span();
        span.set_attribute(Key::new("KEY").string("value"));

        span.add_event(
            format!("Operations"),
            vec![
                Key::new("SigNoz is").string("Awesome"),
            ],
        );
    });
    shutdown_tracer_provider()
```

**Step 4: Set environment variables and run app**


| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT     | This is the url where you have hosted SigNoz  |
| OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name        | Specify  as the value. This will be the name of your Rust application on SigNoz services page, allowing you to uniquely identify the application traces.        |


Now run 
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=sample-rust-app cargo run
```
in terminal to start the application!
