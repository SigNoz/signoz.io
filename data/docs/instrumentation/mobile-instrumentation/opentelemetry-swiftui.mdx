This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your iOS applications built using Swift and view your application traces in SigNoz.


{/* This documentation contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry(OTel) instrumentation in your iOS mobile application built using Swift UI. OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is an open-source observability framework that can help you generate and collect telemetry data - traces, metrics, and logs from your Swift UI application.

Once the telemetry data is generated, you can configure an exporter to send the data to SigNoz for monitoring and visualization.

There are three major steps to using OpenTelemetry:

- Instrumenting your iOS application with OpenTelemetry
- Configuring the exporter to send data to SigNoz
- Validating the configuration to ensure that data is being sent as expected.

In this tutorial, we will instrument a Swift Mobile application for traces and send it to SigNoz. */}

</Admonition>

**Step 1 : Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your Swift application to send traces to OpenTelemetry you need to install [opentelemetry-swift](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift.git) and [grpc-swift](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift) as dependency in your project.

For that, paste the following inside `Package.swift` of your project.

```
 dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.9.1")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift", from: "1.15.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "<service_name>",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "OpenTelemetryApi", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "OpenTelemetrySdk", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "StdoutExporter", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "ResourceExtension", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "ZipkinExporter", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "OpenTelemetryProtocolExporter", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "SignPostIntegration", package: "opentelemetry-swift"),
                .product(name: "GRPC", package: "grpc-swift")
            ],
            path: "."
        )
    ]
```

`<service_name>` is name of your service

**Step 2: Initialize the tracer**

To enable tracing and send traces to the SigNoz cloud, you need to initialize the tracer, to do that create a new file named `OpentelemetrySetup.swift`

```swift
// OpenTelemetrySetup.swift
import Foundation
import GRPC
import NIO
import NIOSSL
import OpenTelemetryApi
import OpenTelemetryProtocolExporterCommon
import OpenTelemetryProtocolExporterGrpc
import OpenTelemetrySdk
import ResourceExtension
import StdoutExporter

struct OpenTelemetrySetup {
    static func configureOpenTelemetry() {
        let resource = DefaultResources().get().merging(other: Resource(attributes: [
            "service.name": AttributeValue.string("<service_name>"), 
        ]))
        
        let otlpConfiguration: OtlpConfiguration = OtlpConfiguration(timeout: TimeInterval(10), headers: [("signoz-ingestion-key", "<your-ingestion-key>")])
        
        let grpcChannel = ClientConnection.usingPlatformAppropriateTLS(for: MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: 1)).connect(host: "ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud", port: 443)
        
        let otlpTraceExporter = OtlpTraceExporter(channel: grpcChannel, config: otlpConfiguration)
        let stdoutExporter = StdoutExporter()
        
        let spanExporter = MultiSpanExporter(spanExporters: [otlpTraceExporter, stdoutExporter])
        
        let spanProcessor = SimpleSpanProcessor(spanExporter: spanExporter)
        
        OpenTelemetry.registerTracerProvider(tracerProvider:
            TracerProviderBuilder()
                .add(spanProcessor: spanProcessor)
                .with(resource: resource)
                .build()
        )
    }
}
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

Once you replace the content of the file, you need to add `init` in the `<project_name>.swift file` 

```swift
init() {
        OpenTelemetrySetup.configureOpenTelemetry()
    }
```

**Step 3: Send Telemetry data to SigNoz**

To send telemetry data to SigNoz, you can create a function to add spans and data. But prior to that you need to import `OpenTelemetryApi` & create instance of tracer, using the following snippet

```swift
import OpenTelemetryApi // Import OpenTelemetryApi for the tracer

//this should be inside ContentView Struct
let tracer = OpenTelemetry.instance.tracerProvider.get(instrumentationName: "SwiftExample", instrumentationVersion: "semver:0.1.0")

// Function to simulate work and create a span
    func doWork() {
        let sampleKey = "sampleKey"
        let sampleValue = "sampleValue"
        
        // Start a new span named "doWork"
        let childSpan = tracer.spanBuilder(spanName: "doWork")
            .setSpanKind(spanKind: .client)
            .startSpan()
        
        // Set an attribute on the span
        childSpan.setAttribute(key: sampleKey, value: sampleValue)
        
        // Simulate some work by sleeping for a random interval
        Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: Double.random(in: 0 ..< 10) / 100)
        
        // End the span
        childSpan.end()
    }
    
```


**Step 4: Run app**

Run your application from X Code to see the output & you can verify the sent span in SigNoz .
