This document contains instructions on how to set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation in your React Native Applications and view your application traces in SigNoz.

### Send traces directly to SigNoz cloud

<Admonition type="warning">
The JS OTel packages are supported for node and web environments. While they work for React Native as well, they are not explicitly supported for that environment, where they might break compatibility with minor version updates or require workarounds. Building JS OTel package support for React Native is an area of active development.
</Admonition>

**Step 1.** Install OpenTelemetry packages

```bash
npm install --save @opentelemetry/api@^1.9.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/core@^1.28.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http@^0.52.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/instrumentation@^0.55.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch@^0.55.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/instrumentation-xml-http-request@^0.55.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/resources@^2.0.1
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base@^1.28.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web@^1.28.0
npm install --save @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions@^1.28.0
```

**Step 2.** Create tracing.jsx file in `/hooks`

  //  Alternatively could offer a TracerProvider that exposed a JS interface on top of the OTEL Android and Swift SDKS,
  //  giving developers the option of collecting telemetry at the native mobile layer
  const provider = new WebTracerProvider({
    resource,
    spanProcessors: [
      new BatchSpanProcessor(
        new OTLPTraceExporter({
          url: 'https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443/v1/traces',

      new SessionIdProcessor(),

  });

  provider.register({
    propagator: new CompositePropagator({
      propagators: [

      // TODO Some tiptoeing required here, propagateTraceHeaderCorsUrls is required to make the instrumentation
      // work in the context of a mobile app even though we are not making CORS requests. `clearTimingResources` must
      // be turned off to avoid using the web-only Performance API
      // Overall wrapping or forking this and providing a React Native specific auto instrumentation will ease
      // integration and make it less error-prone
      new FetchInstrumentation({

      // The React Native implementation of fetch is simply a polyfill on top of XMLHttpRequest:

      // Because of this when making requests using `fetch` there will an additional span created for the underlying

      new XMLHttpRequestInstrumentation({

      }),
    ],

};

export interface TracerResult {
  loaded: boolean;
}

// TODO providing a wrapper similar to this that uses hooks over the full JS OTEL API would be nice to have for both
// React Native and React development
export const useTracer = (): TracerResult => {
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState<boolean>(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loaded) {
      Tracer()
        .catch(() => console.warn("failed to setup tracer"))
        .finally(() => setLoaded(true));
    }
  }, [loaded]);

  return {
    loaded,
  };
};
```

- Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)
- Replace `<your-ingestion-key>` with your SigNoz [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/)
- `<service_name>` is name of your service

**Step 3.** Import it in main entry point of your React Native Application

```jsx
import { useTracer } from "@/hooks/useTracer";

...

const { loaded: tracerLoaded } = useTracer();

...
```

**Step 4.** You can validate if your application is sending traces to SigNoz cloud [here](#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces).

## Validating instrumentation by checking for traces

With your application running, you can verify that you’ve instrumented your application with OpenTelemetry correctly by confirming that tracing data is being reported to SigNoz.

To do this, you need to ensure that your application generates some data. Applications will not produce traces unless they are being interacted with, and OpenTelemetry will often buffer data before sending. So you need to interact with your application and wait for some time to see your tracing data in SigNoz.

Validate your traces in SigNoz:

1. Trigger an action in your app that generates a web request. Hit the endpoint a number of times to generate some data. Then, wait for some time.
2. In SigNoz, open the `Services` tab. Hit the `Refresh` button on the top right corner, and your application should appear in the list of `Applications`.
3. Go to the `Traces` tab, and apply relevant filters to see your application’s traces.
