title: Logstash to SigNoz
id: logstash_to_signoz

If you use logstash to collect logs in your stack with this tutotrial you will be able to send logs from logstash to SigNoz.

At SigNoz we use opentelemetry collector to recieve logs which supports the TCP protocol. So you can forward your logs from your logstash agent to opentelemetry collector

### Collect Logs Using Logstash in SigNoz cloud
  * Add otel collector binary to your VM by following this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).
  * Add the reciever to your `config.yaml` 
    ```yaml
    receivers:
      tcplog/logstash:
        max_log_size: 1MiB
        listen_address: "0.0.0.0:2255"
        attributes: {}
        resource: {}
        add_attributes: false
        operators: []
    ```
    Here we have used port 2255 for listening in TCP protocol, but you can change it to a port you want.
    You can read more about tcplog reciver [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/tcplogreceiver).
 * Modify your `config.yaml` and add the above receiver
    ```yaml {4}
    service:
        ....
        logs:
            receivers: [otlp, tcplog/logstash]
            processors: [batch]
            exporters: [otlp]
    ```
  * Change the logstash config to forward the logs to otel collector.
    ```
    output {
      tcp {
        codec => json_lines # this is required otherwise it will send eveything in a single line
        host => "localhost"
        port => 2255
      }
    }
    ```
    Here we are configuring logstash to send logs to otel-collector that we ran in the previous step, which is listening on port 2255.
    Also we are assuming that you are running the logstash binary on the host. If not, the value of `host` might change depending on your environment. 

  *  Once you make this changes you can otel binary and logstash, and you will be able to see the logs in SigNoz.
  *  To properly transform your existing log model into opentelemetry [log](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md) model you can use the different processors provided by opentelemetry [link](./logs.md#processors-available-for-processing-logs).

## Collect Logs Using Logstash in Self-Hosted SigNoz

* Add the reciever to your `otel-collector-config.yaml` which is present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`
    ```yaml
    receivers:
      tcplog/logstash:
        max_log_size: 1MiB
        listen_address: "0.0.0.0:2255"
        attributes: {}
        resource: {}
        add_attributes: false
        operators: []
    ```
    Here we have used port 2255 for listening in TCP protocol, but you can change it to a port you want.
    You can read more about tcplog reciver [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/tcplogreceiver).

* Update the pipleline for logs and make the following change in `otel-collector-config.yaml`
    ```yaml
    service:
      ...

      logs:
        receivers: [ otlp, tcplog/logstash ]
        processors: [ batch ]
        exporters: [  clickhouselogsexporter ]
    ```
    Here we are adding our clickhouse exporter and creating a pipeline which will collect logs from `tcplog/logstash` receiver, processing it using batch processor and export it to clickhouse.

* Expose the port in port for otel-collector in `docker-compose.yaml` file present in `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`
  ```yaml
  otel-collector:
    ...
    ports:
      - "2255:2255"
  ```

* Change the logstash config to forward the logs to otel collector.
    ```
    output {
      tcp {
        codec => json_lines # this is required otherwise it will send eveything in a single line
        host => "<otel-collector-host>"
        port => 2255
      }
    }
    ```
    In this example we are generating sample logs and then forwarding them to the otel collector which is listening on  port 2255.
    `<otel-collector-host>` has to be replaced by the host where otel-collector is running. For more info check [troubleshooting](../install/troubleshooting.md#signoz-otel-collector-address-grid). 

*  Once you make this changes you can restart logstash and SignNoz, and you will be able to see the logs in SigNoz.
*  To properly transform your existing log model into opentelemetry [log](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md) model you can use the different processors provided by opentelemetry.
