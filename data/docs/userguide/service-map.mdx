Select Service Map tab in the left navigation panel to reach to the service map.

- This map gives an idea of the services in your infrastructure, and how one services calls other.

- The P99 latency, error rate and RPS is shown by hovering above the edge in between services.
- If an edge service map is shown as red, it means that it is having some 4xx error or high latency.
