title: Collecting Kubernetes Pod Logs

SigNoz enables seamless collection of Kubernetes pod logs, allowing you to perform various actions on the data.

## Setup

<Tabs entityName="plans">
<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

To collect logs from your Kubernetes cluster in SigNoz Cloud, deploy the `k8s-infra` chart by following this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/). 

<Admonition type="note">
Log collection of pods from all namespaces is enabled by default except for **kube-system**, **hotrod** and **locust**.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='self-host' label='Self-Host'>

To enable pod log collection and parse attributes such as pod name, namespace, container name, and UID etc. you need to deploy the `k8s-infra` chart in both scenarios:

- **If SigNoz and applications are in the same cluster:** Install the `k8s-infra` chart in the cluster where [SigNoz is deployed](https://signoz.io/docs/install/kubernetes/).
- **If SigNoz is hosted in a separate cluster:** Install the `k8s-infra` chart in the application clusters to monitor them and in the cluster hosting SigNoz to monitor its infrastructure.

Follow [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/) for detailed installation instructions.

<Admonition type="note">
Log collection of pods from all namespaces is enabled by default except for **kube-system**, **hotrod** and **locust**.
</Admonition>

To extract specific attributes from certain types of logs, you can use the various operators provided by OpenTelemetry, available [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/logs/#operators-for-parsing-and-manipulating-logs).

## Customizing Kubernetes Pod Logs Collection

### Disable Automatic Pod Logs Collection

1. Modify/Create `override-values.yaml` file with the below configuration to customize and override default settings 
of the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/blob/main/charts/k8s-infra/values.yaml) file:

```yaml
presets:
  logsCollection:
    enabled: false
```

The `presets` key in the k8s-infra chart includes `logsCollection`, which controls log collection, and setting `enabled: false` disables automatic pod log collection.

2. Apply the configuration:

Run the below command in the directory containing the `override-values.yaml` file.

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade --install <release-name> signoz/k8s-infra -f override-values.yaml
```

`<release-name>`: Replace this placeholder with your helm release name (e.g., `my-monitoring`).

To extract specific attributes from certain types of logs, you can use the various operators provided by OpenTelemetry, available [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/logs/#operators-for-parsing-and-manipulating-logs).

### Exclude/Include/Filter Logs Collection

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="filter-logs" label="Exclude Logs">

To exclude logs based on namespaces, pods, or containers, you need to modify/create `override-values.yaml` file with the below configuration to customize and 
override default settings of the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/blob/main/charts/k8s-infra/values.yaml) file:

```yaml
presets:
  logsCollection:
    # whether to enable log collection
    enabled: true
    blacklist:
      # whether to enable blacklisting
      enabled: true
      # whether to exclude signoz logs
      signozLogs: false
      # which namespaces to exclude
      namespaces:
        - kube-system
      # which pods to exclude
      pods:
        - hotrod
        - locust
      # which containers to exclude
      containers: []
      # additional exclude rules
      additionalExclude: []
```
The `presets` key in the k8s-infra chart includes `logsCollection`, which controls log collection, and enabling `blacklist` allows exclusion of logs from 
specified namespaces, pods, and containers.


Run the below command in the directory containing the `override-values.yaml` file to apply the configuration:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade --install <release-name> signoz/k8s-infra -f override-values.yaml
```

`<release-name>`: Replace this placeholder with your helm release name (e.g., `my-monitoring`).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="include-logs" label="Include Logs">

To include logs based on namespaces, pods, or containers, you need to modify/create `override-values.yaml` file with the below configuration to customize and 
override default settings of the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/blob/main/charts/k8s-infra/values.yaml) file:

```yaml
presets:
  logsCollection:
    # whether to enable log collection
    enabled: true
    whitelist:
      # whether to enable whitelisting
      enabled: true
      # whether to include signoz logs
      signozLogs: false
      # which namespaces to include
      namespaces:
        - platform
        - my-application-namespace
      # which pods to include
      pods:
        - otel  # all pods with otel prefix
        - my-application-pod
      # which containers to include
      containers: []
      # additional include rules
      additionalInclude: []
```
The `presets` key in the k8s-infra chart includes `logsCollection`, which controls log collection, and enabling `whitelist` allows inclusion of logs from 
specified namespaces, pods, and containers.

Run the below command in the directory containing the `override-values.yaml` file to apply the configuration:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade --install <release-name> signoz/k8s-infra -f override-values.yaml
```

`<release-name>`: Replace this placeholder with your helm release name (e.g., `my-monitoring`).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="filter-operator" label="Filter Operator">

To filter logs using [expression](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/types/expression.md), you need to 
modify/create `override-values.yaml` file with the below configuration to customize and override default settings of the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/blob/main/charts/k8s-infra/values.yaml) file:


```yaml
presets:
  logsCollection:
    enabled: true
    operators:
      - type: filter
        expr: 'body matches "^LOG: .* END$"'
        drop_ratio: 1.0
```

This filters logs matching the expression and drops them entirely. Learn more about the filter operator [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md).

Run the below command in the directory containing the `override-values.yaml` file to apply the configuration:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade --install <release-name> signoz/k8s-infra -f override-values.yaml
```

`<release-name>`: Replace this placeholder with your helm release name (e.g., `my-monitoring`).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After making changes to the configuration, restart the OpenTelemetry Collector pod deployed by the `k8s-infra` chart to apply the updates.
