SigNoz can automatically collect all your pod logs and you can perform various action on top of that data.


## Collect Kubernetes Pod Logs in SigNoz Cloud
To collect logs from your kubernetes cluster, you will need to deploy k8s-infra chart. Please follow the guide [here](/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/). Log collection of pods from all namespaces is enabled by default except for pods in `kube-system` and `hotrod`. To modify the log collection mechanism, please follow the guides below.

- [Filter/Exclude logs collection](#steps-to-filterexclude-logs-collection)



## Collect Kubernetes Pod Logs in Self-Hosted SigNoz
When you deploy SigNoz to your kubernetes cluster it will automatically start collecting all the pod logs. It will automatically parse out different attributes from the logs like name, namespace, container name, uid etc. But if you want to parse specific attributes from certain kind of logs you can use different kinds of operators provided by OpenTelemetry [here](/docs/userguide/logs#operators-for-parsing-and-manipulating-logs).

If your signoz cluster is hosted in a different cluster then you will have to install k8s-infra chart on your application kubernetes cluster. Please follow the guide [here](/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/). Log collection of pods from all namespaces is enabled by default except for pods in `kube-system` and `hotrod`. To modify the log collection mechanism, please follow the guides below.

### Steps to disable automatic pod logs collection

* Modify/Create the `override-values.yaml` file
  ```yaml
  k8s-infra:
    presets:
      logsCollection:
        enabled: false
  ```

  You can apply this yaml file by running the following command:

  ```bash
  helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz -f override-values.yaml
  ```  

  In case of external K8s cluster where only k8s-infra chart is installed, users can disable log collections by including the following in `override-values.yaml` :

  ```yaml
  presets:
    logsCollection:
      enabled: false
  ```

  You can apply this yaml file by running the following command:

  ```bash
  helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/k8s-infra -f override-values.yaml
  ```  

  Once the above is applied to your k8s cluster, logs collection will be disabled.

### Steps to Filter/Exclude logs collection

* **Excluding certain log files** : If you want to exclude logs of certain pods/namespace you can do it using the following config in `override-values.yaml`.
  
  ```yaml
  k8s-infra:
    presets:
      logsCollection:
        # whether to enable log collection
        enabled: true
        blacklist:
          # whether to enable blacklisting
          enabled: true
          # whether to exclude signoz logs
          signozLogs: false
          # which namespaces to exclude
          namespaces:
            - kube-system
          # which pods to exclude
          pods:
            - hotrod
            - locust
          # which containers to exclude
          containers: []
          # additional exclude rules
          additionalExclude: []
  ```
  <Admonition>
  In case of  `k8s-infra` chart installed directly, omit `k8s-infra:` from the above configuration. 
  </Admonition>
 

* **Using filter operator in filelog receiver** : You can also use the filter operator to filter out logs by changing the operators here [charts](https://github.com/SigNoz/charts/blob/main/charts/k8s-infra/values.yaml).
  
  ```yaml {3-6}
  ....
    operators:
      - type: filter
        expr: 'body matches "^LOG: .* END$"'
        drop_ratio: 1.0
  ....
  ```

  Here we are matching logs using an expression and dropping the entire log by setting `drop_ratio: 1.0` . You can read more about the filter operator [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md)

* Now you can restart the otel collector pod so that new changes are applied.
