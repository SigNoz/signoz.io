title: Collecting Application Logs from Log File

## Overview

This documentation provides detailed instructions on configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector to read logs from a file and push them to SigNoz, enabling you to 
analyze your application logs effectively.

## Sample Log File

As an example, we can create a sample log file called `app.log` with the following dummy data:

```plaintext
This is log line 1
This is log line 2
This is log line 3
```

This file represents a log file of your application. You can choose any file that contains your application's log entries.

### Setup

#### 1. Install OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector provides a vendor-neutral way to collect, process, and export your telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces.

Follow this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) to install the OpenTelemetry Collector as an agent on your Virtual Machine.

#### 2. Configure Filelog Receiver

Modify the `config.yaml` file created during the installation of the OpenTelemetry Collector to include the `filelog` receiver. Specify the path to your `app.log` file and set the `start_at` parameter.

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog/app:
    include: [ /tmp/app.log ] # Include the full path to your log file
    start_at: end
```

<Admonition>
The `start_at: end` configuration ensures that only newly added logs are transmitted. To include historical logs, set `start_at` to `beginning`.
</Admonition>

#### 3. Update Pipeline Configuration

Update the pipeline settings in `config.yaml` to include the new filelog receiver:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog/app]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector for the changes to take effect. Follow [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/) for restart instructions.

#### 4. Verify Export

The logs will be visible in the Logs Tab of SigNoz. As more entires are added to `app.log` it will reflect Logs tab.

### Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: SigNoz on the Same Host

##### Install SigNoz

Follow [this guide](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/) to install self-hosted SigNoz.

##### Modify Docker Compose File

Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the `deploy/docker` directory to mount your application's log file to the `tmp` directory of the OpenTelemetry Collector.

```yaml
volumes:
  - ~/<path>/app.log:/tmp/app.log
```

Replace `<path>` with the actual path of your log file.

##### Add Filelog Receiver

Update `otel-collector-config.yaml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [ /tmp/app.log ]
    start_at: end
```

<Admonition>
The `start_at: end` configuration ensures only newly added logs are transmitted. To include historical logs, set `start_at` to `beginning`.
</Admonition>

##### Update Pipeline Configuration

Modify the pipeline to include the filelog receiver:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

Restart the OpenTelemetry Collector for the changes to take effect.

#### Scenario 2: SigNoz on a Different Host

##### Create OTel Collector Configuration

Create an `otel-collector-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include: [ /tmp/app.log ]
    start_at: end
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 10000
    send_batch_max_size: 11000
    timeout: 10s
exporters:
  otlp/log:
    endpoint: http://<host>:<port>
    tls:
      insecure: true
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/log]
```

<Admonition>
To use `https`, provide the certificate and key. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlpexporter/README.md) for details.
</Admonition>

##### Mount Log File and Run Collector

Run the following command to start the OpenTelemetry Collector in Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name signoz-host-otel-collector --user root -v $(pwd)/app.log:/tmp/app.log:ro -v $(pwd)/otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml signoz/signoz-otel-collector:0.88.11
```

Adding more entries to `app.log` will make them visible in SigNoz UI.

## Application Deployed on Kubernetes

If your application is running on Kubernetes, you can use the [k8s-infra-chart](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/install-k8s-infra/) to get your logs directly to SigNoz.

The chart has [presets.logsCollection.enabled](https://signoz.io/docs/collection-agents/k8s/k8s-infra/configure-k8s-infra/#3-container-log-collection) property to **true** which adds a `filelogreceiver`. 
This receiver is configured to read the files where Kubernetes container runtime writes all containers console output **(/var/log/pods/*/*/*.log)**.

## Application running on Docker

If you application is running on Docker, you can follow [this doc](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collect_docker_logs/) to get you container logs into SigNoz 
using the filelog receiver
