title: CORS in OTLP HTTP Receiver
---

Enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol)
HTTP receiver is necessary when we want to send requests to our OTLP HTTP receiver
from a different domain using browsers. Without enabling CORS, browsers will block
these requests for security reasons.

By default, SigNoz does not enable CORS for OTLP HTTP receiver, which means it will
block all requests sent via browsers due to security reasons. To change that, we will
have to alter the CORS configurations in the OTLP HTTP receiver.

## Enable CORS in OTLP HTTP Receiver

To enable CORS, there are mainly three steps involved:

1. Open SigNoz OtelCollector configuration and locate `http` receiver section.
  It should look similar to the following:
  ```yaml
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        http:
  ```

2. Add the CORS configuration under `http` receiver section.
  ```yaml
  http:
    cors:
      allowed_origins:
        - https://netflix.com  # URL of your Frontend application
  ```
  Update the above example origin i.e. `https://netflix.com` with your frontend
  application URL. If you are experimenting on your local machine on port `3000`,
  you can use `http://localhost:3000` instead.

  ```yaml
  http:
    cors:
      allowed_origins:
        - http://localhost:3000 
  ```

  To allow any origin to make requests, you can use `*` wildcard character instead.
  However, it is not recommended to set allow all origins due to security risks.

  ```yaml
  http:
    cors:
      allowed_origins:
        - "*"
  ```

3. Save the updated configurations and restart SigNoz OtelCollector.

### Docker

In case of docker, update `otel-collector.yaml` to include CORS configuration
inside `deploy/docker` folder as instructed above.

Followed by clean removal of SigNoz OtelCollector to guarantee updatation of
configuration and restart the SigNoz OtelCollector using `docker compose`:

```bash
# clean remove SigNoz OtelCollector
docker stop signoz-otel-collector
docker rm signoz-otel-collector

# restart SigNoz OtelCollector using `docker compose`
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes

In case of helm charts, copy the `otelCollector.config` section from `values.yaml`
to `override-values.yaml` and include CORS configuration under `otlp.protocols.http`.

Followed by `helm upgrade` command below to restart OtelCollector:

```bash
helm upgrade --namespace platform my-release signoz/signoz -f override-values.yaml
```
