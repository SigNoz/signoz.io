The layout of the application is comprised of sections, panes, dashboards, graphs, entities, and navigation elements. The following sections describe each of these elements.

## Sections

A section provides access to all the functionalities you need to perform a specific activity. For example, the **Metrics** section provides an overview of all your applications. The following example screenshot shows the four applications that come with the [Hot R.O.D.](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/main/examples/hotrod) demo application:

## Panes

A pane is a subdivision of a section dedicated to a set of functionalities. For example, the **Application Details** section contains three separate panes:

- Application Metrics
- External Calls
- Database Calls

## Dashboards

A dashboard is a set of one or more graphs. In the **Dashboard** section, you can create, update, and delete dashboards:

The following example screenshot shows a dashboard named **CPU Load** containing two graphs - **Load Average** and **Total CPU Time**:

### Predefined and Custom Graphs

In SigNoz, a graph can either display a metric over a time interval or only the most recent value. 

SigNoz supports two types of graphs:

- **Predefined graphs** that you can find in the **Metrics** section. You can't modify any of these graphs.
- **Custom graphs** are graphs you create, update, and remove in the **Dashboard** section.

**Common Operations**

This section describes the common operations that you can perform on a graph.

- You can hover over a graph to see the actual values at a specific point in time:

- If your graph shows multiple data series, depending on what you want to highlight, you can enable or disable a specific data series by clicking it at the bottom of the chart. The following example disables the `p95` latency:

  When you enable or disable a specific data series, the system could automatically change the scale of the vertical (value) axis.

- If your graph shows application-related metrics, you can click a point on the graph and then select **View Traces** to open the **Traces** page for that specific point in time:

## Entities

An entity represents a specific type of data, such as an alert. Each entity consists of a series of properties. For example, an alert is defined by a name, expression, period, and labels.

## Navigation Elements

The following illustration shows the **Metrics** section and the primary navigation elements:

**Legend**:

1. **Sidebar**: Lists all the sections. Select a section to open it. The current section is highlighted in blue.
2. **Expand/Collapse** **button**: Select this button to collapse the sidebar, allowing more room for the main part of the page. If the sidebar is already collapsed, select this button to expand it again.
3. **Main body**: This example shows the **Metrics** section.
4. **Global Time Period**: With SigNoz, you can specify the time range for which you want to view data by setting the global time period. SigNoz allows you to either indicate a specific time range such as the last five minutes or specify a start and end date by selecting **Custom** from the drop-down menu:
    ![Specify global time period](/img/specify-global-time-period-v0.6.2.webp)
  <Admonition type="info">
    On some pages, you can override the global time period. For example, when creating a custom graph, you can use the drop-down list under **Panel Time Preferences** to override the global time period:
