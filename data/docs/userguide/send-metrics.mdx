By default, when you install SigNoz, only the [Hostmetric receiver][1]
is enabled. Before you can query other metrics, you must first enable
additional receivers in SigNoz.

There are two ways in which you can send metrics to SigNoz using OpenTelemetry:
- [Enable a Specific Metric Receiver](#enable-a-specific-metric-receiver)
- [Enable a Prometheus Receiver](#enable-a-prometheus-receiver)
- [Find Metrics available in SigNoz](#find-metrics-available-in-signoz)
  - [Metrics from Hostmetrics receiver](#metrics-from-hostmetrics-receiver)
- [Related Videos](#related-videos)
- [Get Help](#get-help)

Depending on your choice, use one of the sections below.

## Enable a Specific Metric Receiver

SigNoz supports all the receivers that are listed in the [opentelemetry-collector-contrib][2]
GitHub repository. To configure a new metric receiver, you must edit the `receivers`
section of the `deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml` file.
The following example shows the default configuration in which the `hostmetrics`
receiver is enabled:

```yaml {14-22}
receivers:
  otlp/spanmetrics:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "localhost:12345"
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      thrift_http:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 30s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      load:
      memory:
      disk:
      filesystem:
      network:
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s
# This file was truncated for brevity
```

To enable a new OpenTelemetry receiver, follow the steps below:

1. Move into the directory in which you installed SigNoz, and open the
  `deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml` file in a
  plain-text editor.
2. Configure your receivers. The following example shows how you can
  enable a receiver named `examplereceiver`:
  ```yaml {23,24}
  receivers:
    otlp/spanmetrics:
      protocols:
        grpc:
          endpoint: "localhost:12345"
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        http:
    jaeger:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        thrift_http:
    hostmetrics:
      collection_interval: 30s
      scrapers:
        cpu:
        load:
        memory:
        disk:
        filesystem:
        network:
    examplereceiver:
      endpoint: 1.2.3.4:8080
  processors:
    batch:
      send_batch_size: 1000
      timeout: 10s
  # This file was truncated for brevity.
  ```
  For details about configuring OpenTelemetry receivers, see the [README][3]
  page of the `opentelemetry-collector` GitHub repository.

## Enable a Prometheus Receiver

SigNoz supports all the exporters that are listed on the
[Exporters and Integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)
page of the Prometheus documentation. If you have a running Prometheus instance,
and you expose metrics in Prometheus, then you can scrape them in SigNoz by
configuring Prometheus receivers in the `receivers.prometheus.config.scrape_configs`
section of the `deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml` file.

To enable a Prometheus receiver, follow the steps below:
1. Open the `deploy/docker/otel-collector-config.yaml`
  file in a plain-text editor.
2. Enable a new Prometheus receiver. Depending on your use case, there
  are two ways in which you can enable a new Prometheus exporter:
    - **By creating a new job**: The following example shows how you can
      enable a Prometheus receiver by creating a new job named `my-new-job`:
      ```yaml {15-18}
      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:
            http:

        # Data sources: metrics
        prometheus:
          config:
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: "otel-collector"
                scrape_interval: 30s
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ["otel-collector:8889"]
              - job_name: "my-new-job"
                scrape_interval: 30s
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ["localhost:8080"]          
      processors:
        batch:
          send_batch_size: 1000
          timeout: 10s
      # This file was truncated for brevity.
      ```
    - **By adding a new target to an existing job**: The following example shows the
      default `otel-collector` job to which a new target (`localhost:8080`) was added:
      ```yaml {14}
      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:
            http:

        # Data sources: metrics
        prometheus:
          config:
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: "otel-collector"
                scrape_interval: 30s
                static_configs:
                  - targets: ["otel-collector:8889", "localhost:8080"]       
      processors:
        batch:
          send_batch_size: 1000
          timeout: 10s
      # This file was truncated for brevity.
      ```

    <Admonition type="info">

    To correctly scrape from prometheus instance running on the host machine, replace
    `localhost:8080` with `172.17.0.1:8080` for Linux and `host.docker.internal:8080`
    for MacOS.
    
    </Admonition>

    Note that all the jobs are scraped in parallel, and all targets inside a job are
    scraped serially. For more details about configuring jobs and targets, see the
    following sections of the Prometheus documentation:
      - [`<scrape_config`>][5]
      - [Jobs and Instances][6]
