You can directly send logs of your application to SigNoz using the Python SDKs provided by OpenTelemetry. [This is an example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/tree/main/docs/examples/logs) of how to 
set it up effectively.

<Admonition>
The default logging level in Python is WARNING. To send all logs to SigNoz, change the default log level to DEBUG.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
</Admonition>

<TabItem value="signoz-cloud" label="SigNoz Cloud" default>

To send logs to SigNoz Cloud, set the following environment variables before running your application:

1. **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT**:
   Set this environment variable to `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443`

   - Set the `<region>` to match your SigNoz Cloud [region](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/overview/#endpoint)


2. **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS**:
   Set this to `signoz-access-token=<your-ingestion-key>`, where `<your-ingestion-key>` is your [ingestion key](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).

3. **Run Command**:
   Use the following command to run your script:

   ```bash
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>" python3 example.py
   ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="self-host" label="Self-Host" default>

To send logs to a Self-Hosted SigNoz, set the following environment variables before running your application:

1. **OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT**:
   
   Set this environment variable to `http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317`
   
   `IP of SigNoz backend` is the IP of the machine where you installed SigNoz. If you have installed SigNoz on `localhost`, the endpoint will be `http://localhost:4317` for gRPC exporter and `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP exporter.
     
    <Admonition>
     The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively. Remember to allow incoming requests to port **4317**/**4318** of machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.
    </Admonition>
2. **Run Command**:
   Use the following command to run your script:

   ```bash
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz Backend>:4317" python3 example.py
   ```
