Now you can send your telemetry data to SigNoz from Vercel using the SigNoz Vercel [Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/signoz).

## Vercel Configuration
* Add the [Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/signoz).
* Select the Vercel account that you want to use.

* Click on add integration and the SigNoz UI open up.

* Click on Integrate to complete the integration


Once the above is completed, you will get your logs data in SigNoz.
## Send trace data on SigNoz  
For sending trace data to SigNoz you will have to make some changes to your application code.
Please follow this [guide](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview). 


# Old Process
If you are running your applications on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can stream logs from Vercel to SigNoz using [log drains](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains-overview/log-drains#configure-a-log-drain).

## Prerequisite
- Vercel Pro or Enterprise accounts
