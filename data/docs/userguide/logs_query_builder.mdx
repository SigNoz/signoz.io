title: Logs Query Builder
id: logs_query_builder
---


We recently released an updated logs explorer page and query builder in SigNoz to make experience of our logs product much more intuitive and seamless.

Some of the key features:
1. Advanced filtering based on attributes and auto suggestions for filters<br></br>

    You can now create more complex queries for how you match attributes, and the query field will automatically suggest both attributes and values for your query.

    ![Logs Query Builder Interface](/img/docs/query-builder/02.webp)

    After entering your query hit 'run query' to see a default bar chart and results down below:

    ![Logs Query Builder Interface](/img/docs/query-builder/03.webp)

    To explore additional ways to filter your query, click 'view details' on any log line to get a list of parameters on the log, and click any value to automatically add a `{attribute} IN {value}` to your query.

    ![Logs Query Builder Interface](/img/docs/query-builder/04.webp)

2. Aggregation options like Group By, ability to specificy aggregation intervals, etc.<br></br>

    The Group By drop down is automatically populated with common attributes, and selecting one, like log level in this example, gets us a few things right away

    * A comparitive bar chart, with a legend (you can enter a format for the legend including explanatory text eg in this case you might enter `The log level is {{level}}` to make the chart more readable by others)

    * A timeseries comparing the relative volume of results by time

3. Plot multiple queries and formulae based on them in the same charts<br></br>

    For comparing two timeseries or values, you can now add multiple queries or formulae on the same chart, which is especially useful if you are comparing similar data across two different services.

4. Modify your query with a click<br></br>

    By clicking on the details of any log line, you can see the attributes for that item. Click any value, and your query will be modified to require that attribute and value.

    ![Logs Query Builder Interface](/img/docs/query-builder/06.webp)

5. Create Dashboards and Alerts in a single click from logs query builder<br></br>

    Directly from results you can add the query to a dashboard and set up an alert. This makes the timeseries view especially useful, as you can now create an alert when a certain event is logged beyond a certain rate.

    ![Logs Query Builder Interface](/img/docs/query-builder/07.webp)

With the alert query you can perform sophisticated comparisons or other math on your measurement from your logs.


## Writing JSON Filters In The New Logs Explorer

In the new logs explorer, you can query your JSON data present inside the body. JSON data in the body will be rendered like this:
![JSON Data in log body](/img/logs/json_log.webp)

You can click on one of the keys and then filter them out
![JSON Data filter](/img/logs/json_log_filter.webp)

If you want to write the query on your own in the filter bar then you can follow the following rules.

* For json query inside body it starts with a prefix `body.`
* To access a value of a key you can use the notation `body.key_name`
* If it is nested key then use `.` to signify nested keys like `body.level1.level2.key`
* If the type of value is array use  `[*]`
* operators supported for arrays are `HAS` and `NHAS`


### Example for JSON filter

Lets say we have this example data in your json log body
```json
{
  "message": "hello",
  "request": {
    "services": [
      "service_1",
      "service_2"
    ],
    "service_meta": [
      {
        "name": "service_1",
        "latency": 101,
        "tags": [
          "tag1",
          "tag2"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "service_2",
        "latency": 200,
        "tags": [
          "tag1",
          "tag2"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* logs where value of message is `hello`
  
    ```
    body.message = hello
    ```
* logs where value of message is contains `he`
  
    ```
    body.message CONTAINS he
    ```
* logs where value of latency of service_1 is >100
  
    ```
    body.request.service_meta[*].latency > 100
    ```
* logs where `tag1` is present in service tags
  
    ```
    body.request.service_meta[*].tags[*] HAS tag1
    ```
* logs where `tag2` is not present in service tags
  
    ```
    body.request.service_meta[*].tags[*] NHAS tag2
    ```




# Logs Query Builder in old Logs Explorer

This section will walk you through the query language that is used by SigNoz for filtering logs in the old logs explorer.

This query language for logs is a simplified version of SQL. The current state of the query language is good enough for daily uses. As of now we don't support nesting and parenthesis for explicit ordering due to added complexity. 

If you have a use case which you are not able to fullfill with the current features please reach out to us on our slack community or Github issues. We plan to improve the query as we go forward while keeping it simple 

## Types of queries supported by SigNoz:
*  **Freehand query** <br></br>
    When a user writes a plan text query without using any kind of operators, the query is directly searched against the log body. ( inefficient over huge log data)

    eg:-`Dispatch Successful`
    
    ![Freehand](/img/logs/logs_query_freehand.webp)
        
*  **Filtering queries** <br></br>
    When a user writes queries using a `key`, `operator` and  a `value` separated by `and` , `or` operators it is a filtering query.
    This kind of queries are faster as they reduce the search space by using indexes.
    
    eg:- `id IN ('2DCVZOsKHioCeuvbObzVzzL1eZ5') AND fulltext contains 'Dispatch Successful'`
    
    ![Filtering](/img/logs/logs_query_filtering.webp)
        
## List of Operators supported by SigNoz
* Here is a list of all the operators that are supported:

    | Operator  | Multivalued | Examples                                             | Meaning                  |
    | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
    | IN        | yes         | num in (1,2,3)<br></br> strdata in ('a', 'b', 'c')   | In                       |
    | NIN       | yes         | num nin (1,2,3)<br></br> strdata nin ('a', 'b', 'c') | Not In                   |
    | GTE       | no          | num gte 10<br></br> dict_word gte 'cat'              | Greater than or Equal to |
    | GT        | no          | num gt 10<br></br> dict_word gt 'cat'                | Greater than             |
    | LTE       | no          | num lte 10<br></br> dict_word lte 'cat'              | Less than or Equal to    |
    | LT        | no          | num lt 10<br></br> dict_word lt 'cat'                | Less than                |
    | CONTAINS  | no          | stream contains 'err'                                | Contains                 |
    | NCONTAINS | no          | stream ncontains 'err'                               | Doesn't Contain          |
    
## Fulltext Key
    
The fulltext key is used when we want to write freehand queries and combine them with filters.

eg:- 
```
id IN ('2DCVZOsKHioCeuvbObzVzzL1eZ5') AND fulltext contains 'Dispatch Successful'
```
In this cases we are searching `Dispatch Successful` as fulltext along with the id filter.

<Admonition>
The `fulltext` keyword can be only used with `contains` and the `ncontains` operator.
</Admonition>
    

## Pointers to note while writing queries
- Text always needs to be **enclosed in single quotes** in **filtering queries**

    eg:-
    If you want to search for logs with stream error and which contains Mozilla in body, the corresponding query on the ui will be 

    ```
    stream IN ('stderr') AND fulltext contains 'Mozilla'
    ```

    as we can see `Mozilla` is enclosed in single quotes as well as `stderr`.

- Order of execution is similar to sql i.e left to right and `and` has higher precedence over `or` , but currently SigNoz doesn’t support combining explicitly using parenthesis.
    
    **correct** ✅ :-
    ```
    stream IN ('stdout') and fulltext contains 'Mozilla' or stream IN ('stderr')
    ``` 

    **incorrect** ❌ :- 
    ```
    (stream IN ('stdout') and fulltext contains 'Mozilla') or stream IN ('stderr')
    ```  
    
    While the above to evaluates to the same expression, it’s not necessarily same for the one below
    
     **correct** ✅ :-
    ```
    stream IN ('stdout') and fulltext contains 'Mozilla' or stream IN ('stderr'
    ``` 

    **incorrect** ❌ :- 
    ```
    stream IN ('stdout') and (fulltext contains 'Mozilla' or stream IN ('stderr'))
    ``` 

Here both the statements are not equivalent of each other **i.e it is currently not supported**

## Query Examples

Here are a few examples of valid and invalid queries:

* **Valid Queries**
