Logstash is an open-source log processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, then transforms and sends it to various destinations. Despite its flexibility, Logstash might not always be the best fit for your specific requirements. In this article, we will look at the top alternatives to Logstash that you may want to consider for your application needs.

But before that, let us have a brief overview of Logstash.

## What is Logstash?

Logstash is a core part of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) Stack, an open-source log management tool and data analytics tool. Logstash, as the log collection engine, collects and unifies data from several sources before sending it to other destinations, usually Elasticsearch, though it can also send data to other destinations for further processing and analysis. 

One major advantage of Logstash is its ability to aggregate data from various sources and the flexibility it provides with a large number of plugins. Logstash can retrieve data from virtually any data origin by using its input plugins, execute various data modification functions through filter plugins, and then transmit the processed data to multiple destinations via output plugins. Despite these benefits, Logstash has certain drawbacks, which we will look at in the section below.

## Limitations of Logstash

Let’s look at the limitations of Logstash that may make you want to consider using its alternatives.

- The biggest drawback of using Logstash is its resource-intensiveness. Logstash uses much more memory compared to other log shippers and log management tools, and this makes it unsuitable to handle large volumes of data as it leads to performance overhead.
- Due to its resource-intensiveness, Logstash tends to be slower than alternatives. Comparative benchmark tests have shown Logstash to be slower than alternatives like Rsyslog and Beats.
- Logstash is entirely command-line and does not have a graphical user interface. While it works well with Elasticsearch and Kibana to visualize its data, it can be challenging to use and configure, particularly for complex use cases.
- Logstash might also be difficult to troubleshoot at times, resulting in maintenance challenges.

## Top 11 Logstash Alternatives

## SigNoz

SigNoz is an open-source observability platform for monitoring applications that allows you to aggregate, store, analyze, and visualize your application data. SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry for collecting telemetry data and supports all frameworks and programming languages supported by OpenTelemetry. Data can be sent from applications directly to the SigNoz Otel collector or external Otel collectors can be used for collecting telemetry data & sending it to the SigNoz Otel collector.

SigNoz provides an easy way to get started through the SigNoz Cloud, with which you don’t need to install or manage the infrastructure. It also provides the option of self-hosting on macOS or Linux computers.
