## Ease of Deployment: Both tools

### Prometheus

Prometheus has different deployment options, which include using pre-compiled binaries on different operating systems (Darwin, Linux, Windows, etc.), using Docker, installing from source, and using configuration management systems like Ansible. It can also be installed using Homebrew, the package manager for macOS.

I deployed Prometheus using Docker; the time this would take will depend on your internet speed as the Prometheus image will be pulled from a Docker registry.

### Grafana

Similar to Prometheus, Grafana provides a range of deployment choices for its self-hosted version to accommodate various operating systems using pre-compiled binaries, including Debian or Ubuntu, SUSE or openSUSE, RHEL or Fedora, and more. Grafana can also be deployed by using a Docker image, on Kubernetes, and on macOS using Homebrew or standalone binaries.

I deployed Grafana using Docker; the time this would take will depend on your internet speed, as the Grafana image will be pulled from a Docker registry.

Grafana also has a cloud version known as Grafana Cloud. This version doesn’t require management of Grafana as it is hosted in the cloud, all it takes is for users to sign up and use.

Overall, deployment with Docker for both tools was straightforward.

## Data Collection: Grafana

### Prometheus

Prometheus excels at collecting data from a diverse range of sources. It uses client libraries to expose metrics via HTTP endpoints, which are then scraped and sent to the Prometheus server. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-http-endpoints.webp" alt="HTTP endpoints Prometheus is scraping metrics from"/>
    <figcaption><i>HTTP endpoints Prometheus is scraping metrics from</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

Additionally, it utilizes exporters to transform metrics from third-party systems into a format that Prometheus can process. For dynamic monitoring, Prometheus leverages file-based service discovery to identify and track targets. It also supports remote endpoints for flexible data collection. This approach allows Prometheus to effectively collect metrics from various sources. 

### Grafana

Grafana has built-in support for many data sources. For additional data sources that are not natively supported, Grafana offers a robust ecosystem of data source plugins. These plugins extend Grafana's capabilities, allowing users to integrate a variety of data sources into their dashboards. If a required data source plugin is not available, Grafana's open-source nature enables the development of custom plugins.

    <figcaption><i>Data sources in Grafana</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


Prometheus and Grafana have great data collection capabilities, but Grafana can collect data from a wider range of data sources.

## Visualization Capabilities: Grafana

### Prometheus

Prometheus has limited visualization capabilities. The built-in expression browser is the primary tool for querying and visualizing data within Prometheus. It offers two main visualization options: a table and a graph. These visualizations are useful for understanding the trends and patterns in the data over time. The expression browser is not as comprehensive or user-friendly as other visualization tools; it’s very basic.

    <figcaption><i>Graph visualization</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


### Grafana

Grafana is known for its excellent visualization capabilities. It offers a wide range of visualization types tailored to different data types, including time series graphs, bar charts, histograms, heat maps, pie charts, candlestick charts, and more.

It can also suggest visualization types based on the queries or data available. This feature presents a preview to users, aiding them in making an informed choice about the type of visualization that best represents their data.

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-visualization-suggestion.webp" alt="Visualization suggestion in Grafana"/>
    <figcaption><i>Visualization suggestion</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


Grafana has highly customizable dashboards, allowing users to fine-tune their visualizations through panel options. Users have the flexibility to add and configure panels, define metrics, and customize the appearance of visual elements to suit their specific needs. These dashboards can also be shared with others, facilitating collaboration for teams.

    <figcaption><i>MySQL database dashboard in Grafana</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


Of both tools, Grafana is the preferred choice for users seeking robust visualization capabilities.


## Log management: Grafana

### Prometheus

Prometheus does not inherently support log management as its primary focus is metrics collection and monitoring. For log management, integrating Prometheus with a dedicated log management solution is recommended.

### Grafana

Grafana, in conjunction with Loki, offers a robust solution for log management. Loki, a component of the Grafana stack, is specifically designed for log aggregation. It is inspired by Prometheus and shares its label-based approach to indexing, making it highly scalable and cost-effective. 

Loki allows you to store and query logs from all your applications and infrastructure, without worrying about log volumes, costs, or storage limits.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-log.webp" alt="Log management with Loki in Grafana"/>
    <figcaption><i>Log management with Loki in Grafana</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


## APM

### Prometheus

Prometheus primarily focuses on metrics monitoring rather than traditional application performance monitoring (APM) in the way that dedicated APM solutions like Datadog or New Relic do. These dedicated APM solutions offer advanced features like distributed tracing, code-level insights, and user experience monitoring. 

While Prometheus can collect metrics related to application performance, such as request latency, error rates, and throughput, it does not provide the same level of detailed tracing and diagnostics that are typically associated with APM tools. Prometheus is more about the "what" (e.g., how many requests are being made, how many errors are occurring) rather than the "why" (e.g., why are certain requests slow, what is causing errors).

### Grafana

Grafana, when leveraged as part of the Grafana stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir), coupled with the integration of Prometheus, provides a robust platform for Application Performance Monitoring (APM). This integrated approach enhances application performance monitoring and provides detailed insights into application health and performance.

Here's a streamlined overview of how the Grafana stack supports Application Performance Monitoring (APM):

- **Prometheus**: Collects application metrics for performance monitoring.
- **Tempo**: Focuses on collecting and storing trace data, offering detailed insights into the request flow across microservices. This trace data is crucial for identifying bottlenecks in application performance.
- **Loki**: Collects and indexes log data from applications for error identification and analysis of events that could impact the application's performance.
- **Mimir**: Provides scalable storage for long-term metrics data, aiding trend analysis of application performance over time and capacity planning.
- Grafana: Provides customizable dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) from applications, trace data, and log data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in your application's performance.


## Data Query: Both tools

### Prometheus

Prometheus provides a powerful and flexible querying language known as PromQL ([Prometheus Query Language](https://signoz.io/blog/prometheus-query/)) for querying and analyzing time-series data. PromQL allows users to perform a wide range of operations, including filtering, aggregation, and mathematical transformations, on the collected metrics data. Users can write expressive queries to extract valuable insights and monitor system performance effectively. With support for functions like rate, sum, and histogram_quantile, PromQL enables advanced analysis and visualization of metrics data. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-promql.webp" alt="Query in Prometheus using PromQL"/>
    <figcaption><i>Query in Prometheus using PromQL</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


### Grafana

Grafana's data query functionality is specific to the data source in use. For instance, if you have configured Prometheus with a MySQLD exporter to collect metrics from a MySQL database and you subsequently select Prometheus as the data source within Grafana, your data queries will be executed using PromQL. You can see an example, as shown in the image below.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-promql-in-grafana.webp" alt="PromQL queries in Grafana with Prometheus as datasource"/>
    <figcaption><i>PromQL queries in Grafana with Prometheus as datasource</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


Similarly, if MySQL is configured as the direct data source in Grafana, the queries executed will be SQL queries, which are native to the MySQL database system.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-sql-in-grafana.webp" alt="SQL query in Grafana with MySQL as data source"/>
    <figcaption><i>SQL query in Grafana with MySQL as data source</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


Overall, both tools have good data query capabilities.

## Data Storage: Prometheus

### Prometheus

Prometheus has an in-built time-series database optimized for high-performance time-series data handling, which allows for efficient querying and retrieval of historical data. The database is specifically designed to store time-series data locally, providing fast access to metrics collected over time.

However, Prometheus does not offer long-term data storage capabilities out of the box. As a result, integrating with other tools is necessary to effectively manage data over extended periods. This integration enables seamless archiving, retention, and analysis of historical metrics beyond the storage capacity of Prometheus' local database.

### Grafana

Grafana uses Mimir, a part of the Grafana stack for metrics storage. Mimir is an open-source, scalable, highly available, multi-tenant time series database (TSDB) specifically engineered for the long-term storage of Prometheus metrics. Its development was motivated by the need to address the scalability limitations of Prometheus, and it is designed to natively ingest Prometheus metrics.

Mimir's architecture is structured to support up to 1 billion metrics, enabling it to offer rapid query performance. It ensures high availability, durable storage, and is capable of scaling horizontally to meet the demands of large-scale deployments.

## Alerting: Both tools

### Prometheus

Prometheus does not provide a built-in feature for configuring alert rules directly. Instead, alerting is managed by a component called Alertmanager. Alertmanager is responsible for handling alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and the delivery of notifications. It can be configured to send alerts to various channels, such as email, on-call notification systems, and chat platforms. This is facilitated through the definition of alerting rules. 

Users define alerting rules using PromQL, setting conditions based on the collected metrics. When these conditions are met, Prometheus generates alert instances. 

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-alerts.webp" alt="Alerts in Prometheus"/>
    <figcaption><i>Alerts in Prometheus</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


These instances are then forwarded to Alertmanager, which handles deduplication, grouping, and routing for prompt notification to email, Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-alertmanager.webp" alt="Triggered alerts sent to Alertmanager from Prometheus"/>
    <figcaption><i>Triggered alerts sent to Alertmanager</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


### Grafana

Grafana allows users to create alerts based on queries and expressions from multiple data sources. Alerting rules are configured through the UI, providing a visually intuitive approach. Users can set up alert rules, add labels, and define notification policies to specify where, when, and how notifications are routed.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-alert-rules.webp" alt="Alert rules in Grafana"/>
    <figcaption><i>Alert rules in Grafana</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


If you want to keep your alerting system separate from your visualization layer, Prometheus's Alertmanager is an excellent choice, as it is a dedicated component offering enhanced flexibility and customization for managing alerts.

If you are already utilizing Grafana for visualization and require a comprehensive, integrated alerting solution, then Grafana's alerting features would be the appropriate choice for your needs.

## Cloud Option: Grafana

### Prometheus

Prometheus does not offer a cloud service or option. This means users are responsible for deploying and managing their Prometheus instances.

### Grafana

Grafana, on the other hand, offers a fully managed cloud service known as  <a href = "https://grafana.com/products/cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Grafana Cloud</a>. This service provides a seamless experience for deploying, managing, and scaling Grafana dashboards and data sources. Grafana Cloud eliminates the need for manual setup and maintenance, allowing teams to focus on creating and sharing insights from their data. It's an excellent choice for organizations looking for a hassle-free monitoring solution that requires minimal operational overhead.

## UI/UX: Grafana

### Prometheus

Prometheus provides a basic web interface, primarily focused on querying and visualizing time series data. The UI is functional but relatively minimalistic, with options for executing PromQL queries, viewing graphs, and exploring metrics. The user experience in Prometheus is straightforward and intuitive.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-prometheus-ui.webp" alt="Prometheus UI"/>
    <figcaption><i>Prometheus UI</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


### Grafana

Grafana offers a visually appealing and robust UI, compared to Prometheus. It has a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction. The user experience in Grafana is designed to be intuitive and accessible.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-ui-grafana.webp" alt="Grafana UI"/>
    <figcaption><i>Grafana UI</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>


Both tools offer satisfactory user experiences, but Grafana has richer UI functionality compared to Prometheus. Grafana not only provides a visually appealing interface but also offers a broader range of features and customization options.

## Pricing: Prometheus

Overall, both tools have excellent documentation and active communities for support, but Grafana, being a self-hosted and managed service, provides more support for users.

## Prometheus vs Grafana: The Final Verdict

Prometheus and Grafana are powerful tools, each with its strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. Understanding their differences is crucial for making the right choice for your monitoring and visualization needs.

Here’s a use-case-based guide for Prometheus vs Grafana:

- If your primary goal is to collect metrics like resource usage, then choose Prometheus.
- If your focus is solely on visualization, choose Grafana.
- If you prefer a highly customizable dashboarding experience with support for multiple data sources, choose Grafana.
- If you want a fully managed option for both visualization and monitoring, choose Grafana Cloud.
- If you want a cost-effective monitoring solution, especially for smaller teams or projects, choose Prometheus.

For effective monitoring and observability of your applications, all your telemetry signals should be under a single pane of glass. Prometheus and Grafana lack this, as Prometheus is limited to monitoring and Grafana to visualization. To get these added telemetry signals in the setup, you would have to integrate Loki and Tempo, part of the Grafana stack, into the setup. This quickly introduces complexity and can be difficult to manage. Even though the Grafana Cloud version provides complete observability through a unified interface, the cost can easily go up as you are charged based on the amount of telemetry data sent and user seats.

## A better Prometheus and Grafana Alternative: SigNoz

SigNoz is a full-stack open-source application performance monitoring and observability tool that serves as an excellent Prometheus and Grafana alternative. It consolidates logs, metrics, and traces under a single pane of glass, providing complete telemetry signals.
