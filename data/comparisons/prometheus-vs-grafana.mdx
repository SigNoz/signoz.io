## APM: Grafana Wins

### Prometheus

Prometheus primarily focuses on metrics monitoring rather than traditional application performance monitoring (APM) in the way that dedicated APM solutions like Datadog or New Relic do. These dedicated APM solutions offer advanced features like distributed tracing, code-level insights, and user experience monitoring.

While Prometheus can collect metrics related to application performance, such as request latency, error rates, and throughput, it does not provide the same level of detailed tracing and diagnostics that are typically associated with APM tools. Prometheus is more about the "what" (e.g., how many requests are being made, how many errors are occurring) rather than the "why" (e.g., why are certain requests slow, what is causing errors).

### Grafana

Grafana, when leveraged as part of the Grafana stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir), coupled with the integration of Prometheus, provides a robust platform for Application Performance Monitoring (APM). This integrated approach enhances application performance monitoring and provides detailed insights into application health and performance.

Here's a streamlined overview of how the Grafana stack supports Application Performance Monitoring (APM):

- **Prometheus**: Collects application metrics for performance monitoring.
- **Tempo**: Focuses on collecting and storing trace data, offering detailed insights into the request flow across microservices. This trace data is crucial for identifying bottlenecks in application performance.
- **Loki**: Collects and indexes log data from applications for error identification and analysis of events that could impact the application's performance.
- **Mimir**: Provides scalable storage for long-term metrics data, aiding trend analysis of application performance over time and capacity planning.
- **Grafana**: Provides customizable dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) from applications, trace data, and log data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in your application's performance.

### Verdict
**Which tool offers better APM capabilities between Prometheus vs Grafana?**

When comparing Prometheus vs Grafana for APM capabilities, Grafana, with its integrated stack, offers a more comprehensive solution for detailed application performance monitoring.



## Data Query: Tie

### Prometheus

Prometheus provides a powerful and flexible querying language known as PromQL ([Prometheus Query Language](https://signoz.io/blog/prometheus-query/)) for querying and analyzing time-series data. PromQL allows users to perform a wide range of operations, including filtering, aggregation, and mathematical transformations, on the collected metrics data. Users can write expressive queries to extract valuable insights and monitor system performance effectively. With support for functions like rate, sum, and histogram_quantile, PromQL enables advanced analysis and visualization of metrics data.

<img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-promql.webp" alt="Query in Prometheus using PromQL"/>
<figcaption><i>Query in Prometheus using PromQL</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Grafana

Grafana's data query functionality is specific to the data source in use. For instance, if you have configured Prometheus with a MySQLD exporter to collect metrics from a MySQL database and you subsequently select Prometheus as the data source within Grafana, your data queries will be executed using PromQL. You can see an example, as shown in the image below.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-promql-in-grafana.webp" alt="PromQL queries in Grafana with Prometheus as datasource"/>
<figcaption><i>PromQL queries in Grafana with Prometheus as datasource</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Similarly, if MySQL is configured as the direct data source in Grafana, the queries executed will be SQL queries, which are native to the MySQL database system.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-sql-in-grafana.webp" alt="SQL query in Grafana with MySQL as data source"/>

**Which tool offers better data query capabilities between Prometheus vs Grafana?**

Overall, both Prometheus and Grafana have good data query capabilities, each excelling in different areas depending on the data source and use case.

## Data Storage: Prometheus Wins

### Prometheus

Prometheus has an in-built time-series database optimized for high-performance time-series data handling, which allows for efficient querying and retrieval of historical data. The database is specifically designed to store time-series data locally, providing fast access to metrics collected over time.

However, Prometheus does not offer long-term data storage capabilities out of the box. As a result, integrating with other tools is necessary to effectively manage data over extended periods. This integration enables seamless archiving, retention, and analysis of historical metrics beyond the storage capacity of Prometheus' local database.

### Grafana

Grafana uses Mimir, a part of the Grafana stack for metrics storage. Mimir is an open-source, scalable, highly available, multi-tenant time series database (TSDB) specifically engineered for the long-term storage of Prometheus metrics. Its development was motivated by the need to address the scalability limitations of Prometheus, and it is designed to natively ingest Prometheus metrics.

Mimir's architecture is structured to support up to 1 billion metrics, enabling it to offer rapid query performance. It ensures high availability, durable storage, and is capable of scaling horizontally to meet the demands of large-scale deployments.

### Verdict
**Which tool offers better data storage capabilities between Prometheus vs Grafana?**

When we compare Prometheus vs Grafana in terms of data storage, Grafana’s Mimir provides a more scalable and robust solution for long-term storage of metrics.

## Alerting: Tie

### Prometheus

Prometheus does not provide a built-in feature for configuring alert rules directly. Instead, alerting is managed by a component called Alertmanager. Alertmanager is responsible for handling alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and the delivery of notifications. It can be configured to send alerts to various channels, such as email, on-call notification systems, and chat platforms. This is facilitated through the definition of alerting rules.

Users define alerting rules using PromQL, setting conditions based on the collected metrics. When these conditions are met, Prometheus generates alert instances.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-alerts.webp" alt="Alerts in Prometheus"/>
<figcaption><i>Alerts in Prometheus</i></figcaption>
</figure>

These instances are then forwarded to Alertmanager, which handles deduplication, grouping, and routing for prompt notification to email, Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/02/prometheus-vs-grafana-alertmanager.webp" alt="Triggered alerts sent to Alertmanager from Prometheus"/>
<figcaption><i>Triggered alerts sent to Alertmanager</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Grafana

Grafana allows users to create alerts based on queries and expressions from multiple data sources. Alerting rules are configured through the UI, providing a visually intuitive approach. Users can set up alert rules, add labels, and define notification policies to specify where, when, and how notifications are routed.
