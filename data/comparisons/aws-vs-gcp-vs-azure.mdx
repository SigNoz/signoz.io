Cloud computing has transformed business operations, providing unprecedented flexibility, scalability, and innovation. Among the leading cloud platforms, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure stand out for their extensive service offerings. Choosing the right platform can be challenging, given their unique strengths and capabilities. 

This comprehensive guide will help you understand the key differences between AWS, GCP, and Azure, enabling you to make an informed decision that aligns with your organization’s needs and goals.

## Understanding Cloud Computing Platforms

Cloud computing revolutionizes the way businesses access technology. Instead of managing physical hardware, companies can now tap into a pool of on-demand computing resources like servers, storage, databases, and artificial intelligence tools. Using the cloud, businesses can scale quickly, cut costs, and innovate without the overhead of maintaining their IT infrastructure.

One of the key offerings of cloud -platforms is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). This service model lets you rent virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, on a pay-as-you-go basis. With IaaS, companies gain the flexibility to adjust their infrastructure based on current needs, avoiding the long-term commitments and costs associated with physical servers. This capability supports dynamic scaling, enabling businesses to respond efficiently to changing demands. 

### History and Market Share
