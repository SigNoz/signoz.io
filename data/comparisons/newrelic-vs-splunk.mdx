## Getting Started: New Relic

New Relic is widely known for its user-friendly interface and ease of use. I found the onboarding process for New Relic to be seamless. It was very easy to set up and start monitoring my application.

Splunk, on the other hand, has a steep learning curve. As someone with no prior experience using Splunk, it was difficult to understand and navigate the platform. As someone who is used to monitoring and observability platforms using a unified interface, it was surprising to find out that Splunk had different platforms for different use cases.

Overall, New Relic is easier to get started with.

## APM: New Relic

I instrumented a sample Python application and sent data to both New Relic and Splunk for APM. The steps taken in New Relic were straightforward and simpler compared to Splunk. New Relic required the installation of the New Relic agent as well as the agent specific to my application, which, in my case, was the Python agent. Splunk had more setup steps.

With New Relic, you can effectively monitor your application's trace data through its pre-built dashboards. Within the Distributed Tracing page, you can filter traces by Trace Groups, Root entry span, Root entity, and Errors. This allowed me to focus more on specific traces with failures and latency issues.

    <figcaption><i>APM in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>



The visualization options it offers helped me better understand and analyze my trace data. This includes flame graphs, service maps, tables, and charts. The flamegraphs, most especially, provided end-to-end visibility into the time spent on each function or service call, which I find useful for troubleshooting.

    <figcaption><i>Visualization using flamegraphs</i></figcaption>
</figure>



With Splunk, you can efficiently collect and analyze all your trace data to get insights into your application’s performance. Additionally, it supports tag-based grouping of traces and provides visualization options such as service maps and flame graphs for better analysis.

Splunk employs AI-driven directed troubleshooting to quickly identify and highlight the root causes of issues within microservices, even in high-volume environments, offering a centralized view of trends in latency and errors, ranked by error rate or latency.

</figure>


Some other Splunk APM features include:

- Infinite cardinality exploration: To understand how different factors impact your application’s performance.
- Real-time streaming analytics: Detects and alerts on customer issues within seconds.
- Full-stack observability: Access to Splunk logs and events for better troubleshooting and root-cause analysis.

For a seamless APM experience, New Relic’s APM feature is a good option. If you need more options and customizations, use Splunk.

## Log Management: Splunk

New Relic doesn’t require an extra setup for log management. It automatically collected the logs from my application and displayed them in the Logs tab. These logs can be queried through the use of Lucene, an open-source search library, and the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). If you're familiar with SQL queries, using NRQL should be straightforward due to its SQL-like syntax.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/newrelic-vs-splunk-logs.webp" alt="Log management in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Log management in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>



Some other log management features New Relic provides include:

- Attributes: Provides additional context and information about the event being logged, such as error codes or user IDs.
- Patterns: Groups log events based on common characteristics or sequences of attributes.
- Obfuscation: Hides sensitive information in your logs.

Splunk is well known for its log management capabilities, it can manage large volumes of data. Splunk aggregates data from various Splunk platforms into the Splunk Observability Cloud, where it is centrally managed. It didn’t automatically ingest my data like New Relic, I had to set this up manually.

Log management in Splunk can be carried out using the <a href = "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/log-observer-connect.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Log Observer Connect</a> feature. This allows for the correlation of logs with real-time metrics and traces, and log-based analysis to better understand patterns in your data.

    <figcaption><i>Log observer in Splunk</i></figcaption>
</figure>


For enterprise-level log management capabilities, Splunk is an excellent choice. If you have less log management requirements, you can consider New Relic.

## Application Security: Splunk

Application security in New Relic is carried out using the <a href = "https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/iast/introduction/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Interactive Application Security Testing</a> (IAST) feature. IAST was able to identify and fix vulnerabilities in my application environment. It displayed the types of risk being introduced into the environment and categorized them based on the level of severity. Currently, IAST supports only Java, Node.js, and Go.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/newrelic-vs-splunk-security.webp" alt="Application security in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Application security in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>



Splunk on the other hand has different security products and apps that protect applications and the overall system from attacks. 

Here’s what some of Splunk’s security products can do:

- The Splunk Security Essentials app provides a consolidated, real-time view of your entire system to detect threats.
- The Splunk Enterprise Security tool allows users to understand their organization's security posture. It also identifies potential security risks by analyzing diverse data sources and recognizing suspicious patterns indicative of attacks.
- The Splunk attack analyzer helps to discover and investigate cyber-attacks and threats. It also provides information on how they can be rectified.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>

    <figcaption><i>Security monitoring in Splunk</i></figcaption>
</figure>



If you want to focus on the security of your applications alone, New Relic is a better choice. If you want a comprehensive security tool that focuses on both your applications and the overall system, then go for Splunk.

## OpenTelemetry Support: Splunk

OpenTelemetry is now emerging as the standard way of generating telemetry data from applications. As an open-source tool that is still gaining support, integrating full support for its features and functionalities into existing monitoring platforms might take time.

While both New Relic and Splunk offer support for OpenTelemetry, it's worth noting that the level of support in both tools is not optimal.

If you require a tool with complete OpenTelemetry support, consider using an OpenTelemetry native tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), which is also open-source.

## Pricing: New Relic

New Relic and Splunk are costly to use. The following points might help you decide which tool is better suited for your needs:

### New Relic

- Pricing is based on two things:
    - Amount of data ingested
    - User Seats
- New Relic provides a free forever plan with 100GB of free data ingest each month.
- Post 100GB, you need to pay \$0.3/GB or \$0.5/GB ingested based on your plan.
- User seats can get [expensive](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-user-based-pricing-collaborate-seamlessly-with-signoz). New Relic allows only 5 full platform users in its standard plan, and the cost of full platform users can be up to \$549/user per month for enterprise plans.

### Splunk

- The pricing model is complex and expensive.
- The actual price of using Splunk is not explicitly stated on the Splunk website. Users need to contact the sales team.
- You get a 15-day free trial period.

While New Relic is also expensive to use, it is a more cost-effective solution when compared to Splunk. If your primary concern is cost, New Relic should be your choice.
