</figure>



New Relic’s APM feature provided me with real-time monitoring of my application’s telemetry data, including metrics, logs, events, and transactions, through a combination of pre-built and custom dashboards. On the Distributed Tracing page, I was able to filter traces by Trace Groups, Root entry span, Root entity, and Errors. This allowed me to focus more on specific traces with failures and latency issues.

</figure>


Both tools have good APM capabilities. If you require deep insights into your application and its performance, New Relic is a better choice. 

## Log Management: Grafana for cost effectiveness, New Relic for better log insights

Grafana uses Loki from the Grafana stack for log management. Loki is a log aggregation tool designed to store and query logs from all your applications and infrastructure. 

Loki indexes only the metadata (labels) of logs, compresses them into chunks and then stores them in object storage like S3 buckets. The compressed chunks, smaller index, and use of low-cost object storage, makes Loki less expensive to use.

Other features of Loki:

- Live tailing of logs as they come into the system
- Ingests logs without requiring any formatting requirements.
- You can build metrics and generate alerts from your log lines

    <figcaption><i>Loki visualization through Grafana</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Log management in New Relic didn’t require any setup at all, my application and system logs were automatically collected by the New Relic agent. I could immediately visualize and query them in the logs tab. Log query in New Relic is done using Lucene, an open-source search library, and the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). They both allow for instant query and analysis of log data.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/new-relic-vs-grafana-log-nr.webp" alt="Log management in New Relic"/>
    <figcaption><i>Log management in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Other New Relic log management features include:

- Root cause analysis for troubleshooting
- Live archives for compliance
- Ingest logs from anywhere using New Relic and open-sourceforwarders.
- Dive deeper into log data by using our logs UI, and create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts.

If your focus is log aggregation, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, Grafana Loki is the better choice. If you prioritize a friendly GUI with more search capabilities to better understand your log data, choose New Relic.

## Infrastructure Monitoring: New Relic

Grafana Cloud allows for infrastructure monitoring of AWS, Kubernetes, and Grafana integrations such as Linux machines, databases, applications, and more. It provides a managed Grafana instance, integration with various data sources, powerful visualization tools, and alerting capabilities. This allowed me to focus on monitoring my infrastructure without the complexities of managing the underlying infrastructure. I was also able to create customized dashboards to monitor specific metrics from my infrastructure.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/new-relic-vs-grafana-kubernetes.webp" alt="Kubernetes monitoring in Grafana"/>
    <figcaption><i>Kubernetes monitoring in Grafana</i></figcaption>
</figure>


In New Relic, you can monitor different infrastructure types by deploying the infrastructure agent. The agent automatically collected and sent data from my host infrastructure and services running on it to the New Relic platform. It provided out-of-the-box dashboard for me to visualize my infrastructure data.

With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can:

- Query your data to drill down into your infrastructure events and build custom dashboards to share with your team.
- Address performance issues, regardless of the origin through APM data connection with infrastructure monitoring.
- Manage alert settings directly from the relevant infrastructure chart.
- You can also see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's or host's UI.

This comes in handy for post-incident reports, providing valuable insights for future incident management strategies.

For better incident management using advanced technologies, providing more features and allowing collaboration with team mates for faster incident resolution, choose New Relic.

## Application Security: New Relic

Grafana does not exactly have an inbuilt product or feature for application security but it does allow for integration with open-source tools like <a href = "https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >MergeStat</a> and OSV-Scanner for scanning vulnerabilities in environments. You can also configure security hardening for additional security, to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by an attacker.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2024/03/new-relic-vs-grafana-osv.webp" alt="OSV scan dashboard"/>
    <figcaption><i>OSV scan dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Application security in New Relic is carried out using the <a href = "https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/iast/introduction" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Interactive Application Security Testing</a> (IAST) feature. IAST provided 360 visibility into the risks and vulnerabilities in my application. The built-in guardrails within IAST were instrumental in mitigating these security risks. 

IAST can be incorporated into development processes as it allows for the identification and resolution of security issues without the need for separate, time-consuming security testing phases. This approach streamlines the development workflow, ensuring that security considerations are integrated seamlessly into the development lifecycle.

    <figcaption><i>Application security in New Relic</i></figcaption>
</figure>


If you require a platform with in-built application security feature, New Relic is the clear choice. If you have an existing security solution you want to integrate with your monitoring platform, then choose Grafana.

## Pricing: Grafana

Grafana being an open-source platform is free to use. Additionally, it offers both a cloud version and an enterprise version to cater to a wide range of user needs. The Grafana Cloud edition provides a free forever plan, and the enterprise version with a 14-day free trial.

New Relic’s pricing is based on two things: the amount of data ingested and user Seats. It also provides a free forever plan with 100GB of free data ingest each month. Post the 100GB, you need to pay \$0.3/GB or \$0.5/GB ingested based on your plan. 

New Relic’s user seats can get [expensive](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-user-based-pricing-collaborate-seamlessly-with-signoz) as it allows only 5 full platform users in its standard plan, and the cost of full platform users can be up to \$549/user per month for enterprise plans.

Both tools offer a free and paid plan, but if you want a completely free self managed solution, choose Grafana open source version.
