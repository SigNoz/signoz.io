## Integration and Compatibility

Before OpenTelemetry (OTEL) came along, tools like New Relic relied on their own proprietary agents to gather telemetry data. These agents were specifically tailored to instrument certain libraries and send that data back to their respective systems. While New Relic's native agents still do their job, OTEL offers a lot more flexibility. For instance, it shines in situations involving managed services or SaaS endpoints where proprietary agents might not cut it. With OTEL, you can easily switch between different telemetry storage providers without having to redo all your instrumentation.

When you integrate OpenTelemetry with New Relic, OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to collect telemetry data, while New Relic offers a robust platform to analyze and derive insights from that data, giving you a complete view of your software stack.

<Figure src="/img/comparisons/2024/10/opentelemetry-vs-newrelic-image%201.webp" alt="Reference architecture of OpenTelemetry with New Relic (Picture from: New Relic)" caption="Reference architecture of OpenTelemetry with New Relic (Picture from: New Relic)" />

New Relic has recognized the growing importance of OpenTelemetry and now supports data ingestion from OpenTelemetry-instrumented applications. This integration allows you to:

**Send OpenTelemetry traces and metrics to New Relic**: 

Typically, you start by configuring the Collector with a processor that enhances the APM telemetry by adding extra context through resource attributes before exporting the data to New Relic using OTLP. New Relic then identifies this correlation data and builds relationships between APM and infrastructure entities based on those resources. While the specifics of the configuration can differ depending on requirements, collectors that send data to New Relic should have certain things in common such as
    - OTLP Exporter: The OpenTelemetry Collector can export data using the OTLP/HTTP exporter, so it's important to configure it according to New Relic's OTLP requirements.
    - Batch Processor: It sets up the Collector to utilise the batch processor for exporting records in batches, provided you adjust the batch size and frequency to comply with New Relic's OTLP requirements.

**Visualize OpenTelemetry data alongside New Relic's native telemetry** 

Once OTEL data is ingested by New Relic, you can view and analyze both OTEL and New Relic's native telemetry concurrently. This feature is particularly useful in environments where deploying New Relic's native agents may not be feasible, such as certain cloud or serverless setups—OpenTelemetry effectively bridges that gap. You still benefit from New Relic's robust platform capabilities, including dashboards, alerts, analytics, and distributed tracing for both data types.

**Leverage New Relic's analysis and alerting capabilities on OpenTelemetry data to enhance your observability**

By integrating this data with New Relic's powerful analytics, you can gain valuable insights into application performance and reliability. Users can create customized dashboards, set alerts based on specific metrics, and visualize trends, streamlining monitoring and enabling quicker anomaly detection. Additionally, New Relic's machine learning algorithms help proactively identify potential performance issues, ensuring smoother application operation.

### Possible Challenges of integrating OpenTelemetry with New Relic

- **Mapping between OpenTelemetry and New Relic data models may not be perfect**: OTEL serves as an open standard for cross-platform integration, while New Relic's model is tailored for its ecosystem. This can lead to mismatches in interpreting spans, attributes, and resource metadata, resulting in issues like loss of detail, inconsistent tagging, or gaps in telemetry data. Consequently, some nuances may not fully translate, limiting the use of New Relic's advanced analytics and visualization features when the source data comes from OTEL.
- **Some advanced New Relic features might require additional configuration**: New Relic's agents are specifically designed for smooth integration within its ecosystem. In contrast, OpenTelemetry offers greater flexibility but demands additional effort to set up and manage the data pipeline.
- **Performance overhead of running both OpenTelemetry and New Relic agents**: Running OpenTelemetry (OTEL) and New Relic agents simultaneously can lead to significant performance overhead due to their similar operational methods. Both agents utilize low-level language hooks through techniques like byte-code manipulation or monkey patching, which can result in conflicts. While they might work side by side, generating telemetry independently, they also risk overriding each other's changes, potentially causing bugs or degraded performance. Thus, it's recommended to use only one APM product at a time to avoid compatibility issues.

### Benefits of combining OpenTelemetry with New Relic

- **Future Backend Flexibility**: OpenTelemetry (OTEL) allows you to send telemetry data to various backends. If you switch from New Relic to another tool like Dynatrace or Prometheus, you won't need to redo instrumentation, as OTEL manages this process while New Relic's agents are tied to its ecosystem.
- **Standardized Instrumentation**: Integrating OpenTelemetry with New Relic ensures consistent instrumentation across your tech stack, regardless of language or platform. Its open-source framework standardizes traces, metrics, and logs, enhancing maintainability and reducing complexity while leveraging New Relic's analytics.
