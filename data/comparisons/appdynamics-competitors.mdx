AppDynamics is a popular app and infrastructure monitoring solution. It has an AIOps-driven alert system that makes it a full-stack solution for several monitoring use cases. But despite its capabilities, users usually seek alternatives. This article is a deep dive into why.

## Why look for AppDynamics alternatives?

Enterprises seek alternatives to AppDynamics for five reasons: complexity, cost, agent-based monitoring, intensive sales process, and vendor lock-in and integration.

### 1. Complex UI

Although AppDynamics’ usability in several monitoring use cases is a plus, it also confers an increase to the tool’s features—all aggregating into an interface that is so complex you may have a tough time navigating it. While the team provided a docs platform to solve this challenge, it unfortunately also has a steep learning curve.

This doesn’t take away the fact that the tool has been appropriate for organizations with budgets large enough to contain training and onboarding allocations. Still, it also tells why smaller companies seem to jet-ski away from the tool.

### 2. Cost

Feature-rich tools—like Appdynamics—typically cost more. Although different packages and pricing models— the Premium, Enterprise, and Enterprise for SAP editions—exist for different company sizes, the tool’s licensing and subscription fees can be prohibitive. In the end, if the overall TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of using AppDynamics exceeds its ROI (Return on Investment), companies will surely scout for a more cost-effective alternative.

### 3. Intensive Sales Process

AppDynamics' sales process is a call-to-sign-up approach that can span days or weeks. Developers don’t like to take sales calls. It introduces delays and scares off companies seeking a direct, autonomous approach to onboarding.

### 4. Agent-Based Monitoring

AppDynamics gathers data from your application using agents and controllers. Although agent-based solutions gather deeper performance insights, they can be complex and time-consuming to install, increase resource consumption, and introduce maintenance overhead. Enterprises that find the trade-offs of AppDynamics’ agent-based approach too steep surely port to AppDynamics’ competitors.

### 5. Vendor Lock-in and Integration

Since AppDynamics does not work with open-source platforms, it is difficult to integrate with or switch to other monitoring tools. Dependence on a single vendor for monitoring hinders interoperability with other tools. To prevent this limitation from impacting their ability to migrate in the future, organizations choose open-source solutions with broader integration capabilities.

## Appdynamics’ Top 9 Competitors

Here are the top AppDynamics competitors—some fit specific requirements, and some are ideal for any use case.
