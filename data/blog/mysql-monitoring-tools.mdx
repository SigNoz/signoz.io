## Choosing the right tool to monitor your MySQL databases

MySQL database servers process huge amounts of transaction, and these transactions are critical to users using your application. Database performance issues, if not resolved timely, can lead to huge losses in business opportunities. As such, having a robust monitoring tool for your MySQL servers is critical.

One of the biggest concerns you should address while choosing a monitoring tool for MySQL should be how easily the tool lets you correlate your database queries with user interactions. Having complete visibility on the entire request involving MySQL queries can help engineering teams debug performance issues faster.

You can monitor your MySQL servers in isolation, but it would be much more effective if the monitoring tool helps you monitor MySQL servers with contextual information like which service made the call along with resource metrics from your infrastructure. For this to happen, the tool must have capabilities like distributed tracing. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), the open-source APM, provides distributed tracing as one of its major features.

Using SigNoz, you can trace your MySQL queries and see the entire request in its entirety. SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry as the agent to instrument your application and database calls. <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is quietly becoming the standard way of instrumenting cloud-native applications. By choosing SigNoz, you can future-proof your monitoring stack with effective monitoring of MySQL database servers.

SigNoz is open-source, you can check out the repo on GitHub:
