## Top 11 MySQL monitoring tools

Here are the top 11 MySQL monitoring tools:

### SigNoz MySQL monitoring (open-source)

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an open-source APM tool that can help you monitor your MySQL database. With SigNoz, you can monitor your entire software system. You can track application metrics as well as infrastructure metrics. SigNoz is especially suited to monitor modern cloud-native applications based on microservices and serverless architecture.

Most modern applications are complex distributed systems, with multiple database instances serving queries from different services. As an APM tool that monitors all your services, SigNoz can monitor the performance of database calls from every service.

    <figcaption><i>You can monitor Database calls from each service of your application based on microservices architecture</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>

SigNoz also provides a metrics builder using which you can create customized dashboards to monitor your MySQL databases. You can also monitor the health and performance of the host machines where your MySQL database is hosted.

</figure>

<br></br>

SigNoz also provides [distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/), using which you can visualize completely how a user request performs in its entirety. You can trace calls from your frontend web application to any database interactions made during the call. You can pinpoint specific MySQL queries which are causing performance bottlenecks.

</figure>

<br></br>

It's very easy to get started with SigNoz. SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can [sign up](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. It can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple install script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

### Prometheus (open-source)

<a href = "https://prometheus.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> enables you to capture time-series data as metrics. You can capture metrics about MySQL query performance and stats about your MySQL deployments using Prometheus.

You will need to install a MySQL exporter that will collect metrics from your MySQL deployments and relay them to a Prometheus server.

Prometheus comes with a very basic visualization layer. So it is generally used with Grafana, a visualization tool to create charts and metrics.

Prometheus does not provide distributed tracing; hence it will not provide you with contextual information for your MySQL database queries. But it can give you good insights into how your single MySQL instances are performing.

## Choosing the right tool to monitor your MySQL databases

MySQL database servers process huge amounts of transaction, and these transactions are critical to users using your application. Database performance issues, if not resolved timely, can lead to huge losses in business opportunities. As such, having a robust monitoring tool for your MySQL servers is critical.

One of the biggest concerns you should address while choosing a monitoring tool for MySQL should be how easily the tool lets you correlate your database queries with user interactions. Having complete visibility on the entire request involving MySQL queries can help engineering teams debug performance issues faster.

You can monitor your MySQL servers in isolation, but it would be much more effective if the monitoring tool helps you monitor MySQL servers with contextual information like which service made the call along with resource metrics from your infrastructure. For this to happen, the tool must have capabilities like distributed tracing. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), the open-source APM, provides distributed tracing as one of its major features.

Using SigNoz, you can trace your MySQL queries and see the entire request in its entirety. SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry as the agent to instrument your application and database calls. <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is quietly becoming the standard way of instrumenting cloud-native applications. By choosing SigNoz, you can future-proof your monitoring stack with effective monitoring of MySQL database servers.

SigNoz is open-source, you can check out the repo on GitHub:
