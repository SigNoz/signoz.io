Are you looking for a New Relic alternative? Then you have come to the right place. New Relic is a comprehensive observability tool. But it might be too complex for your use case, or you might have been bugged by its complex pricing policies like user seats-based pricing. We have made a list of top 11 New Relic alternatives that you might want to consider.



![Cover Image](/img/blog/2023/12/new-relic-alternatives-cover.webp)

New Relic provides an array of tools for monitoring and observability. But it’s not meant for everyone. New Relic’s user pricing can go up to $549/user. Even for teams with 10-15 devs, the cost becomes significant. At scale, the cost of adding users can go up to 66% of the total bill. ([Learn more](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-user-based-pricing-collaborate-seamlessly-with-signoz))

As a legacy tool, users are also getting stuck with its documentation and tooling.

## SigNoz (Open-Source)

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/common/signoz_flamegraphs.webp" alt="New Relic Alternative - SigNoz"/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a great New Relic alternative that is open-source and provides three signals in a single pane of glass. You can monitor logs, metrics, and traces and correlate signals for better insights into application performance.

One of the biggest benefits of using SigNoz over New Relic is adding as many team members as you like to improve collaboration. ([Learn more](https://signoz.io/product-comparison/signoz-vs-newrelic/).)

With SigNoz, you can do the following:

- Visualise Traces, Metrics, and Logs in a single pane of glass
- Monitor application metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints.
- Find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed [flamegraphs](https://signoz.io/blog/flamegraphs/) of individual request traces.
- Run aggregates on trace data to get business-relevant metrics
- Filter and query logs, build dashboards and alerts based on attributes in logs
- Monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization or memory usage
- Record exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript
- Easy to set alerts with DIY query builder

### Who is SigNoz for?

SigNoz is a great fit for engineering teams looking for an open-source alternative to New Relic. SigNoz also offers cloud and enterprise plans. This makes it a great choice for teams that want the flexibility of having their dev and staging environment on open-source and their prod services monitored by SigNoz cloud.

SigNoz is also a [great choice](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-apm/) for engineering teams that want to shift their observability stack to OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the open-source standard for cloud-native application instrumentation for observability. It provides many benefits like no vendor lock-in, future-proof instrumentation, and covers a lot of use-cases.

SigNoz is built to support OpenTelemetry natively. OpenTelemetry is <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >backed</a> by Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is the second most active project after Kubernetes in the CNCF landscape. OpenTelemetry frees you from vendor lock-in and offers a host of other benefits.

SaaS vendors like New Relic and Datadog [do not support OpenTelemetry data well](https://signoz.io/blog/is-opentelemetry-a-first-class-citizen-in-your-dashboard-a-datadog-and-newrelic-comparison/). If you want to use OpenTelemetry, then SigNoz is a much better choice than New Relic.

### Pricing

The pricing of SigNoz is usage-based. The cloud plan starts at \$49 per month, which includes data usage. After that, logs and traces are charged at \$0.3 per GB ingested and metrics at \$0.1 per mn samples.

You can find more details on pricing [here](https://signoz.io/pricing/).

## Grafana - Loki, Tempo, Mimir

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/12/new-relic-alternatives-grafana.webp" alt="New Relic Alternative - Grafana"/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>


### What is Grafana?

Grafana started as a data visualization tool whose primary strength lies in its integration with various data sources. It is primarily used for monitoring metrics and data visualization. For application observability, Grafana provides Loki, Mimir, and Tempo.

- **Loki**: A log aggregation system designed for storing and querying logs efficiently. Loki is closely integrated with Grafana, allowing users to query their logs directly from the Grafana dashboard.
- **Mimir**: An extension of Prometheus, Mimir provides scalable, long-term storage for metrics data, enhancing Grafana's metrics visualization and analysis capabilities.
- **Tempo**: A [distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/) backend, Tempo works with Grafana to store and retrieve traces, aiding in the analysis of distributed systems performance.

Grafana is open-source, and you can self-host the above tools based on your needs. If you don’t want to self-host, you can use the paid services of Grafana cloud. In Grafana Cloud, Loki, Mimir, and Tempo work together to provide a comprehensive observability suite.

### Who is Grafana for?

Grafana is suited for DevOps teams that need to monitor time-series data from multiple data sources. Grafana Cloud is also suited for teams that need logs, metrics, and traces under a single pane of glass. Companies choose Grafana for the following reasons:

- **Data Visualization capabilities:** Grafana offers a lot of different types of graphs, like Gauge charts, Pi charts, Bar charts, line charts, etc., with an interactive user interface that makes it easier to visualize different metrics,
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** It offers rich visualizations from different data sources, which makes it easier for users to understand the health metrics of different infrastructure components.
- **Open Source:** Many companies choose Grafana because they prefer to self-host and control costs for their observability system.

### Pricing

Grafana offers several pricing tiers for their cloud services:

1. **Cloud Free**: A no-cost tier with limited usage, including 50GB each for logs, traces, and profiles, 10,000 series metrics, 500 virtual user hours for k6 testing, and up to 3 team members.
2. **Cloud Pro**: Priced at \$29/month plus usage costs. This includes higher limits like 100GB for logs, traces, and profiles, 20,000 series metrics, 1,000 virtual user hours, and support for 5 Grafana monthly active users.
3. **Cloud Advanced**: At \$299/month plus usage, it offers usage limits similar to Cloud Pro but with additional features like 24/7 support and access to all enterprise plugins.
