ELK is the acronym Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, and combined together, it is one of the most popular log analytics tools. Elastic changed the license of Elasticsearch and Kibana from the fully open Apache 2 license to a proprietary dual license. The ELK stack is also hard to manage at scale. In this article, we will discuss 14 ELK alternatives that you can consider using.



![Cover Image](/img/blog/2023/10/elk-alternatives-cover.webp)

The ELK stack started with Elasticsearch which is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is the data processing engine, and Kibana lets users visualize data in Elasticsearch with charts and graphs. The ELK stack can either be self-hosted, or users can opt for a cloud version provided by Elastic. The Elk stack is a very popular solution for log analytics. But scaling an ELK stack can be costly, and there are many alternatives available that you should explore.

## What is log management?

Log management is the method of collecting, parsing, storing, analyzing, and utilizing log files and log messages from your applications, servers, and other infrastructure components to provide insights for troubleshooting, debugging performance issues, and identifying security threats.

## Reasons to look for ELK alternatives

Though ELK is a popular log management tool, there are use-cases that it might not be best suited for. Some of the scenarios where people look out for ELK alternatives are:

- **Cost Concerns:** While ELK offers a powerful stack, its cost can escalate quickly, especially at scale.

- **Complex Setup and Maintenance:** The ELK stack can be complex to set up and maintain, particularly for small teams or projects with limited operational capabilities.

- **Performance Issues at Scale:** Although ELK is designed to scale, some users may experience performance issues as their data volume grows. 

<LogsPerf />

- **Limited Customization and Extensibility:** Users who require more customization and extensibility than what ELK offers may look for alternatives that provide more flexibility in terms of data processing, visualization, and integration with other tools.

We have prepared a list of 14 ELK alternatives that you can consider in place of the ELK stack.

## SigNoz (Open Source)

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack open source APM that provides log collection and analytics. SigNoz uses a columnar database ClickHouse to store logs, which is very efficient at ingesting and storing logs data. Columnar databases like ClickHouse are very effective in storing log data and making it available for analysis. 

Big companies like Uber have <a href = "https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/logging/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >shifted</a> from the Elastic stack to ClickHouse for their log analytics platform. Cloudflare too was using Elasticsearch for many years but <a href = "https://blog.cloudflare.com/log-analytics-using-clickhouse/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >shifted to ClickHouse</a> because of limitations in handling large log volumes with Elasticsearch.

In a [logs performance benchmark](https://signoz.io/blog/logs-performance-benchmark/) with SigNoz and ELK, there were two key findings:

- For ingestion SigNoz is **2.5x faster than ELK** and uses **50% less resources.**
- SigNoz is about **13 times faster than ELK** for aggregation queries.
- Storage used by SigNoz for the same amount of logs is **about half of what ELK uses**.

SigNoz uses <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry</a> for instrumenting applications. OpenTelemetry, backed by <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >CNCF</a>, is quietly becoming the world standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

The logs tab in SigNoz has advanced features like a log query builder, search across multiple fields, structured table view, JSON view, etc.

</figure>


It's very easy to get started with SigNoz. It can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple install script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

## Choosing the right log analytics tool

One of the most challenging parts of analyzing log data is the sheer volume of data generated. An effective log analytics tool should efficiently collect and store huge volumes of data. Once the data is collected and stored, log analysis is where tools can make a difference. Enabling users to search through logs quickly and run queries and aggregates to identify the root cause of issues in their application or infrastructure are critical aspects of a good log analytics tool.

While choosing a log analytics tool, a few factors should be kept in mind.

- How efficiently can the tool store logs?
- How easy is using the UI to analyze log data from multiple sources?
- Does the tool provide features to correlate log data with other telemetry signals like metrics and traces for deeper insights?

SigNoz supports efficient log storage, provides an intuitive UI, and lets you correlate your logs with traces and metrics for quicker analysis. SigNoz is also open source and can be self-hosted within your infrastructure.
