In today's digital economy, more and more companies are shifting to cloud-native and microservice architecture to support global scale and distributed teams. But distributed systems also make it impossible for engineering teams to track how user requests perform across services. Application performance monitoring tools provide the visibility needed to resolve performance issues quickly in distributed systems.

New Relic is a great SaaS tool when it comes to application performance monitoring. But there are a few challenges when it comes to enterprise SaaS products, and it's just not a great fit for every company.

Some of the challenges with tools like New Relic includes:

- It is cloud-only, so not suitable for companies that have concerns with sending data outside their infra
- For any small feature, you are dependent on their roadmap. We think this is an unnecessary restriction for a product which developers use. A product used by developers should be extendible
- User-based pricing. New Relic charges based on user seats which can get very expensive in case of large engineering teams.
- Pricing plans of enterprise tools can sometimes leave you in a lurch with frequent changes.



<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/11/new-relic-unethical-billing.webp" alt="New Relic's unethical billing" caption="User complaining about unethical billing practices from New Relic (Source: Reddit)" />

Some of the key features of good observability tools are:

- Logs, metrics, and traces under a single pane of glass
- Out of the box application metrics
- Way to go from metrics to traces to find why some issues are happening
- Seamless flow between metrics, traces & logs — the three pillars of observability
- Filtering of traces based on different tags and filters
- Ability to set dynamic thresholds for alerts
- Transparency in pricing

## Why choose an open-source alternative to New Relic?
APM and observability tools are critical tools in a developer's kit. These tools improve developer efficiency, save bandwidth by resolving issues quickly, and increase developer productivity.

An open-source product is always a better choice for any developer tool. Some of the key advantages of open-source developer tools are:

- **Open codebase**<br></br>
Developers can judge the quality of the code of the tool they want to choose and work with.

- **Extensibility**<br></br>
If an extra feature or customization is required, developers can build on top of the open-source tool without waiting for the enterprise support team to include their request in the next product cycle.

- **Community support**<br></br>
One of the best parts about open-source projects is the community. An example is <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>OpenTelemetry</b></a>, which is becoming the world standard for generating and managing telemetry data in cloud-native applications.

- **Transparency**<br></br>
With open-source projects, you know what you're dealing with. There is no black box.

- **On-prem installation**<br></br>
If your data privacy policies are stringent, you can use open-source tools within your infra with no fear of breaching data privacy laws like GDPR.

But most open-source projects don't provide a great user experience as SaaS products do. It takes a lot of time and effort to get them working, figuring out the long-term storage, etc.

And that's where SigNoz shines. It is very simple to get started, supports multiple tech-stack, and comes with a SaaS-like web user experience.

### Application metrics

Get out of the box p90, p99 latencies, RPS, Error rates and top endpoints for a service out of the box.

    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/common/signoz_charts_application_metrics.webp" alt="SigNoz dashboard showing popular RED metrics"/>
    <figcaption><i>SigNoz UI showing application overview metrics like 50th/90th/99th Percentile latencies, request rate and Apdex</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Seamless flow between telemetry signals

Powered by OpenTelemetry's [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/), you can quickly jump between telemetry signals in SigNoz. Found something suspicious in a metric, just click that point in the graph & get details of traces which may be causing the issues. Seamless, Intuitive.

Similarly, we have enabled correlation between other telemetry signals.

#### APM Metrics to Traces & Logs
    
<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/09/introducing-correlation-of-signals-apm-charts-to-logs.webp" alt="APM metrics to Traces & Logs" caption="Quickly jump from APM metrics to traces or logs to investigate issues further" />


#### Traces to Logs

If you see a API call taking more time than usual, you can go to related logs to investigate further.

<Figure src="/img/blog/common/traces-to-logs.webp" alt="Traces to related logs" caption="Go from traces to related logs to get more context in debugging performance issues" />

Similarly you can click on detailed view of logs and then go to related trace ID to see the flow of user requests.

<Figure src="/img/blog/common/logs-to-trace.webp" alt="Logs to traces" caption="Go from logs to related trace ID in flamegraph view to see the flow of user requests" />


#### Logs with Infrastructure metrics

While troubleshooting with logs, you can investigate the related infrastructure metrics to see if issues are happening becuase of that.

<Figure src="/img/blog/2024/09/introducing-correlation-of-signals-logs-to-infra-metrics.webp" alt="Logs to infra metrics" caption="Check Pod and Node metrics while troubleshooting with logs" />

### Quick filers & Advanced Query Builder for all telemetry signals

For all telemetry signals, there are quick filters to quickly filter out the data needed. We have built customized query builders for each signal to make your troublshooting work easier.

For example, query builder for traces allows you to create queries for finding the p99 latency of services.

<Figure src="/img/blog/common/trace-query-builder.webp" alt="Trace Query Builder" caption="Create queries on your trace data by using various aggregate functions and group by options" />

Similarly, use quick filters to quickly filter the data that you need.

<Figure src="/img/blog/common/logs-quick-filter.webp" alt="Logs quick filter" caption="Use quick filter in logs to quickly filter out specific logs based on your use case" />

You can create custom metrics from filtered traces to find metrics of any type of request. Want to find p99 latency of `customer_type: premium` who are seeing `status_code:400`. Just set the filters, and you have the graph. Boom!


### Flamegraphs & Gantt charts

Detailed flamegraph & Gantt charts to find the exact cause of the issue and which underlying requests are causing the problem. Is it a SQL query gone rogue or a Redis operation is causing an issue? Get more context on your spans with tags and events.

    <figcaption><i>Spans of a trace visualized with the help of flamegraphs and gantt charts in SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Logs Management

SigNoz provides Logs management with advanced log query builder. You can also monitor your logs in real-time using live tailing. SigNoz uses a columnar database ClickHouse to store logs, which is [very efficient at ingesting and storing logs data](https://signoz.io/blog/logs-performance-benchmark/). Columnar databases like ClickHouse are very effective in storing log data and making it available for analysis.
