## Top Kubernetes Monitoring Tools

### Signoz

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<LiteYoutubeEmbed id="jD36hjfL1x0" mute={false} />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

[Signoz](https://signoz.io/) is an Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool that provides the added benefits of logs, metrics, exceptions, and alerts. What sets Signoz apart is that it’s OpenTelemetry-Native. Why does OpenTelemetry matter? Let’s take a glance:

1. It’s <a href = "https://github.com/signoz/signoz" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >open-source</a> and standardized. You are free from vendor lock-ins.
2. Installation and integration are simple, with little to no code.

Now that you know the benefits of OpenTelemetry, let’s take a look at the benefits of Signoz:

**Features of SigNoz**

1. Get application metrics such as p90, p99, error, and request rates right out of the box.
2. Monitor Rate-Error-Duration (RED) metrics.
3. External calls, including database calls, are monitored.
4. Logs, metrics, and traces under a single pane of glass.
5. ClickHouse-based storage is much more efficient than ELK and Grafana Loki for storing logs.
6. Create feature-rich dashboards to chart out any metrics - from JVM to Prometheus-exposed ones.

The [community edition](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) is free for use if you’re planning to host it on your own infra. If you’re looking for a SaaS solution, then [SigNoz cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) is your answer.

### Prometheus

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/12/kubernetes-monitoring-tools-prometheus.webp" alt="Kubernetes monitoring tool - Prometheus"/>
    <figcaption><i>Prometheus Dashboard (Source: Metricfire website)</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

Developed by SoundCloud, and now a part of the CNCF (Cloud-Native Computing Foundation), <a href = "https://prometheus.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a> is the next tool on our list. At its core, Prometheus is a time-series database. What sets it apart is its flexible query language - PromQL.

For monitoring via Prometheus, your applications running on Kubernetes need to expose metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint. While manual configuration is an option, the <a href = "https://prometheus-operator.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Prometheus Operator</a> makes your life easy.

**Features of Prometheus**

1. Utilizes a pull model for collecting metrics rather than applications having to push data.
2. Support for client libraries for different languages.
3. Built-in expression browser for quick visualization.
4. Strong community support.

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Flexible query language - PromQL                       | Aggregated metrics might not reveal actual numbers   |
| Allows third-party integrations                        | Only supports metrics; no support for logs or traces |
| Highly dimensional data model based on key-value pairs | Built-in visualization is limited                    |

### Grafana

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/12/kubernetes-monitoring-tools-grafana.webp" alt="Kubernetes monitoring tool - Grafana dashboard"/>

</figure>
<br/>

You cannot talk about Prometheus without mentioning <a href = "https://grafana.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Grafana</a>. Grafana comes with its own stack called LGTM - **L**ogs (Grafana Loki), **G**rafana (Dashboard visualization), **T**races (Grafana Tempo), and Metrics (Grafana Mimir and Prometheus).

While Prometheus is a popular choice for monitoring Kubernetes, the Grafana dashboard can also connect with other databases, such as InfluxDb.

**Features of Grafana**

1. Can connect to different data sources.
2. Powerful visualization support, which is highly customizable.
3. Full Kubernetes monitoring using Grafana Cloud - from Clusters to individual Pods.

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Support for multiple data sources                      | Large number of queries might slow down the dashboard load time |
| Extensive visualization with support for alerts        | Learning curve for different data sources                       |
| Highly dimensional data model based on key-value pairs | Limited out-of-the-box support for Kubernetes                   |

### Kubernetes Dashboard

### cAdvisor

<a href = "https://github.com/google/cadvisor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Container Advisor</a>, commonly known as cAdvisor, is an open-source container resource collector. It provides you with insights into resources along with the performance characteristics of your containers.

With native support for Docker containers, you can run cAdvisor as a <a href = "https://github.com/google/cadvisor/tree/master/deploy/kubernetes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >daemonset</a> for Kubernetes.

**Features of cAdvisor**

1. Per-node operation with auto-discover of all containers in it.
2. Collects CPU, Memory, Network usage, and histograms of complete historical resource usage.
3. Has a Web UI and exposes REST endpoints.
4. Supports exporting data in different formats such as for ElasticSearch.

| Pros                                                                       | Cons                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

</figure>
<br/>

Beyond basic metrics and logs, <a href = "https://sentry.io/welcome" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Sentry.io</a> offers comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring coupled with deep insights into your cluster's health.

Sentry is a powerful option having its primary focus on identifying and resolving issues before they impact your users. This makes it a valuable addition to any Kubernetes monitoring strategy.

It comes with <a href = "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-kubernetes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" > sentry-kubernetes</a>, a beta-versioned Kubernetes event reporter.

**Features of Sentry**

1. Automatically captures and groups errors, eliminating noise - including noise from Kubernetes itself.
2. Analyzes application performance across services and transactions.
3. Provides actionable data on errors - including stack traces, user information, and affected versions.

## Factors To Consider When Choosing a Kubernetes Monitoring Tool

Let’s take a look at the top factors you should consider before choosing a Kubernetes monitoring tool for your Kubernetes workload:

1. **Functionality** - It should support metrics coverage, alerting, logging, and troubleshooting. Additionally, it should be scalable and have security measures.
2. **Integration** - Your monitoring tool won’t operate in a silo. Support for integrations is always important, be it with cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, or other tools.
3. **Ease of use** - A factor often overlooked, but ease of use is important. Does the tool come with a proper installation guide along with documentation? Does the UI/UX feel responsive and fit your needs?
4. **Support** - Next comes support. Community support is as important as support from official channels. Make sure you check the SLAs.
5. **Future-proofing** - When you're going for a tool, chances are you're not going to change it soon. You need to ensure that the solution is stable and has a future roadmap ready.

## Conclusion

Effective Kubernetes monitoring is vital for optimizing containerized workloads.
