OpenTelemetry can be used to trace Go applications that use Kafka to find performance issues and bugs. OpenTelemetry is an open-source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/)) that aims to standardize the generation and collection of telemetry data. Telemetry data includes logs, metrics, and traces.

Apache Kafka introduced the ability to add headers to Kafka messages from version 0.11 onwards. A <a href = "https://kafka.apache.org/20/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/header/Header.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Header</a> is a key-value pair, and multiple headers can be included with the key, value, and timestamp in each Kafka message. OpenTelemetry provides a library through which we can add all relevant tracing metadata into headers alongside Kafka messages.

For this tutorial, we will be using the Sarama library for Apache Kafka by Spotify. Sarama is a Go library for Apache Kafka.

OpenTelemetry provides client libraries for instrumenting Sarama. You can check out the Golang implementation for OTel Sarama libraries on <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/github.com/Shopify/sarama/otelsarama" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

Before we demonstrate how to implement OpenTelemetry libraries for tracing Kafka clients, let’s have a brief overview of OpenTelemetry.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

<a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is an open-source vendor-agnostic set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to [instrument applications](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/) to create and manage telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces) a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

The telemetry data is then sent to an observability tool for storage and visualization.

</figure>


OpenTelemetry is the bedrock for setting up an observability framework. It also provides you the freedom to choose a backend analysis tool of your choice.

## OpenTelemetry and SigNoz

In this article, we will use SigNoz as our backend analysis tool. SigNoz is a full-stack open-source APM tool that can be used for storing and visualizing the telemetry data collected with OpenTelemetry. It is built natively on OpenTelemetry and works on the OTLP data formats.

SigNoz provides query and visualization capabilities for the end-user and comes with out-of-box charts for application metrics and traces. It also provides logs management. With logs, metrics, and traces under a single dashboard, SigNoz is a open-stop open source observability platform.

Now let’s get down to implementing OpenTelemetry libraries for tracing Kafka clients.

## Installing SigNoz

First, you need to install SigNoz so that OpenTelemetry can send the data to it.

SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple installation script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.

[![Deployment Docs](/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp)](https://signoz.io/docs/install/)

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/application).

## Running Go Kafka application with OpenTelemetry

We will need to deploy Kafka locally before we proceed with creating the application. Create a new folder named `kafka` and inside it, create a file named `docker-compose.yaml`. Paste the below code snippet in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```jsx
version: '3'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.0.1
    container_name: zookeeper
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000

  broker:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    container_name: broker
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: 'zookeeper:2181'
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT_INTERNAL://broker:29092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR: 1
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
```

Start Kafka and Zookeeper by using the following command:

```jsx
docker compose up -d
```

The containers should be visible once they are running. You can check them by running `docker ps`.

</figure>


Clone the <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-kafka-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sample Golang application</a> repo.

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-kafka-app.git
```

The sample app repo has two branches: `main` and `without-instrumentation`. The `main` branch has completed code sample. If you want to follow along with the tutorial, checkout the `without-instrumentation` branch after going to the root folder.

```jsx
cd sample-golang-kafka-app
git checkout without-instrumentation
```

Create a folder named `config`. 

```jsx
mkdir config
```

Inside the `config` folder, initialize the config module by running the following commands:

```jsx
cd config
go mod init github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-kafka-app/config
```

Now we will initialize OpenTelemetry. Create a file named `config.go` and paste the following snippet:

```go
package config

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/credentials"
)

var (
	serviceName  = os.Getenv("SERVICE_NAME")
	collectorURL = os.Getenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT")
	insecure     = os.Getenv("INSECURE_MODE")
)

func InitTracer() func(context.Context) error {

	secureOption := otlptracegrpc.WithTLSCredentials(credentials.NewClientTLSFromCert(nil, ""))
	if len(insecure) > 0 {
		secureOption = otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()
	}

	exporter, err := otlptrace.New(
		context.Background(),
		otlptracegrpc.NewClient(
			secureOption,
			otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint(collectorURL),
		),
	)

	resources, err := resource.New(
		context.Background(),
		resource.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("service.name", serviceName),
			attribute.String("library.language", "go"),
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Could not set resources: ", err)
	}

	tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
		sdktrace.WithSampler(sdktrace.AlwaysSample()),
		sdktrace.WithBatcher(exporter),
		sdktrace.WithResource(resources),
	)
	otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
	otel.SetTextMapPropagator(propagation.NewCompositeTextMapPropagator(propagation.TraceContext{}))
	return exporter.Shutdown
}
```

Modify `go.mod` in producer and consumer folder by adding `replace github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-kafka-app/config => ../config`

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/05/opentelemetry_kafka_modify_go_mod.webp" alt="Modify go.mod in kafka producer and consumer folder"/>
</figure>


Import config in both consumer.go and producer.go:

```jsx
import (
	....
	....
	config "github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-kafka-app/config"
)
```

To initialise OpenTelemetry, call the `InitTracer` function from both `consumer.go` and `producer.go`:

```go
func main(){
	cleanup := config.InitTracer()
	defer cleanup(context.Background())
	.....
	.....
}
```

In `main` function inside `consumer.go` wrap the consumer with the OTel library. This is done so that the consumer is instrumented by OpenTelemetry.

```go
func main(){
	.....
	consumer := Consumer{
			ready: make(chan bool),
	}

	handler := otelsarama.WrapConsumerGroupHandler(&consumer)
	.....

}
```

Since we wrapped our consumer with the open-telemetry library, in `consumer.go` modify the `client.Consume`  function call and pass `handler` instead of `&consumer`.

```go
.......
if err := client.Consume(ctx, strings.Split("quickstart", ","), handler); err != nil {
			log.Panicf("Error from consumer: %v", err)
}
```

In `producer.go` wrap the producer. This is done so that the producer is instrumented by OpenTelemetry.

```go
func main() {
	....

	producer, err := sarama.NewSyncProducer(strings.Split(kafkaAddress, ","), config)
	if err != nil {
		log.Panicf("Error creating consumer group client: %v", err)
	}

	producer = otelsarama.WrapSyncProducer(config, producer)

 ....
}
```

Run `go mod tidy` in both the producer and consumer folder.

Run consumer:

```jsx
SERVICE_NAME=goKafkaConsumer INSECURE_MODE=true OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 KAFKA_ADDRESS=localhost:9092 go run consumer.go
```

Run producer:

```jsx
SERVICE_NAME=goKafkaProducer INSECURE_MODE=true OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 KAFKA_ADDRESS=localhost:9092 go run producer.go
```

You will start seeing messages created by the producer and they are being consumed by the consumer.

## Monitor your Kafka application with SigNoz

Once your Kafka-based golang application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry, you can visualize the data collected with OpenTelemetry in SigNoz dashboards.

Go to the `Traces` tab, you will see `goKafkaProducer` and `goKafkaConsumer` under the `Service Name` filter.

The table in the screenshot below shows [spans - a key concept of distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/). Spans represent a logical unit of work in completing a user request.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/05/otel_kafka_traces_tab.webp" alt="Traces tab of SigNoz showing spans captured from kafka client"/>
    <figcaption><i>You can trace your application’s interaction with Kafka client using the Traces tab of SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>


Using Flamegraphs and Gantt charts, you can see the detailed breakdown of each request.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2022/05/otel_kafka_flamegraphs.webp" alt="Breakdown by requests from Kafka Producer and consumer"/>
    <figcaption><i>Flamegraphs and Gantt charts visualize how Kafka producer and consumer interacted</i></figcaption>
</figure>


The above visualization shows us the following details:

- `kafka.produce` function in `goKafkaProducer` took 5.31 ms to send the message to Kafka.
- `kafka.consume` function of `goKafkaConsumer` took 0.5 ms to consume the message from Kafka.
- The gap between the spans is the time period for which the message was transferred from `goKafkaProducer` to `goKafkaConsumer` via Kafka.

## Conclusion

Apache Kafka plays a critical role in cloud-native distributed applications based on mciroservices architecture. Kafka producers and consumers don’t know about each other and work asynchronously. Although it enables a lot of use-cases for modern applications, Kafka also brings operational complexity.

OpenTelemetry can help solve this complexity by tracing Kafka clients, giving much-needed visibility into how different components of a distributed system interact.

Once your application is instrumented with OpenTelemetry, you can use SigNoz to visualize the interactions in rich detail. SigNoz is built natively on OpenTelemetry and is also open-source. You can try out SigNoz by visiting its GitHub repo 👇
