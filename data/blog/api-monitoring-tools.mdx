In this article, we will review the top 17 API monitoring tools which you can use for monitoring your APIs. But first, let’s have a brief overview of APIs.

### What is an API?

An API (stands for **Application Programming Interface**) allows your product or service to talk to other products or services. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. In this way, they allow you to open up data and functionality to other developers and to other businesses.

APIs communicate through a set of rules that define how computers, applications, or machines can talk to each other. They act as a middleman between any two machines that want to connect with each other for a specified task.

### What is API Monitoring?

API monitoring is a way of continuously keeping track of the state of the APIs. In other words, API monitoring is a process of continuously checking the health, performance, metrics, logs, etc., of the APIs across all the services that run across the application.

### Key API Metrics to Monitor

You have to keep track of some of the key API metrics in order to successfully run your services with high performance and low error rates.

**Some of the Key API Metrics are:**

- **API Uptime:** Uptime is the continuous availability of an API, in order words, making sure the API is fully-functional without any outages.

- **Requests Per Minute:** Requests per minute is a performance metric that measures the number of requests the API will handle per minute.

- **CPU Usage:** Keeping track of the CPU is one of the important aspects of performance because high CPU usage can mean the server is overloaded, which can cause a severe bottleneck.

- **Latency:** Latency or Network Latency is the time it takes for data or a request to go from one system to another system. It can be either between client & server or server & server(in the case of distributed services).

- **Memory Usage:** Memory usage helps you understand the amount of resource utilization; a high memory usage can be an indicator of servers overloaded.

- **Time To First Hello World:** TTFHW is the time the user needs to make his first API transaction from the web page.

- **Errors Per Minute:** Errors per Minute (or error rate) is the number of API calls with failure responses.

### SigNoz (Open Source)

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack open source APM that can be used for effective API monitoring. It is built to support OpenTelemetry natively. OpenTelemetry is an open source project under Cloud Native Computing Foundation that is becoming a world standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

SigNoz can be used to monitor metrics for API performance. It is well-suited to monitor APIs in applications based on microservices or serverless architecture. You can monitor the top endpoints of all your services and get important metrics like P95 and P99 latencies.

Some of the key features of SigNoz include:

- Monitor important application metrics of each service with out-of-box charts and visualization.
- For each service, monitor top endpoints and their key metrics
- Drill down into the performance of each API with tracing data showing all [spans](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/) processed by the endpoint
- Analyze API calls as part of the whole user request with [Flamegraphs and Gantt charts](https://signoz.io/blog/flamegraphs/)

To see your application performance at a glance, you can use the `Metrics` tab. The top endpoints of your services will be listed in the `Top endpoints` table.

    <figcaption><i>Monitor important application metrics like application latency, requests per sec, error percentage, and top endpoints of your monitored services</i></figcaption>
</figure>



You can then analyze the performance of each request that hits your endpoint with tracing data. The `Traces` tab provides powerful filters to analyze each event(or span) of that endpoint.

### Prometheus (Open Source)

<a href = "https://prometheus.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Prometheus</a> is an open source metrics monitoring tool. It was initially developed at SoundCloud in 2012 before being released as an open-source project. It got accepted into the CloudNative Computing Foundation in 2016 and was the second project to graduate from the foundation, following Kubernetes.

You can use Prometheus to monitor your REST APIs. Prometheus is a good tool for monitoring any kind of time-series data. By time-series data, we mean metrics that change over time. For example, requests per second on an endpoint.

Prometheus provides a very basic visualization layer, and it is usually combined with Grafana to create better visualization. It also provides an alertmanager to create alerts on critical metrics.

{/* <!-- <figure data-zoomable align='center'>

### Graphite (Open Source)

<a href = "https://graphiteapp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Graphite</a> is an open-source monitoring tool focused on storing time-series data. It has three main components: Carbon, Whisper, and Graphite. Carbon listens for time-series data. Whisper is used for storing the time-series data, and Graphite web is used to render graphs.

Graphite’s UI is not that great, and they provide integration with Grafana to build better charts for visualization.

The primary purpose of Graphite is to store numeric time-series data and render graphs of this data. Time-series data is a sequence of data points for a particular metric indexed over time. It can give you insights into the performance of any application, process, or service.

Graphite does not do data collection. Instead, your app needs to be configured to send data to Graphite which passively listens for data using Carbon - a Twisted daemon. Carbon then sends the data to Whisper to store the time-series data on a filesystem.

Just like Prometheus, Graphite can be used to monitor API performance.

## Choosing the right API monitoring tools

Selecting the appropriate API monitoring tool is pivotal for effectively monitoring and resolving issues within applications. When evaluating potential tools, users should prioritize solutions that provide comprehensive visibility into their API ecosystem. This includes real-time insights into API response times, error rates, throughput, and dependencies. The ideal tool should be able to trace requests across distributed systems and identify performance bottlenecks for efficient troubleshooting and optimization. In this regard, SigNoz stands out as a robust option.

SigNoz is a full-stack open surce APM tool designed natively for OpenTelemetry, a powerful framework for generating and collecting telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces). This integration ensures thorough monitoring of service endpoints and offers valuable insights into key metrics like P95 and P99 latencies, service error rates, external API interactions, and individual endpoint performance.

Its [distributed tracing](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-in-microservices/) capabilities allow for quick identification of the root causes of API failures. With just a few clicks, you can delve into the exact traces responsible for the problem, allowing you to visualize and analyze detailed flamegraphs of individual request traces. This level of granularity empowers you to identify performance bottlenecks, dependencies, and anomalies with precision and facilitates rapid troubleshooting and optimization.

## Final Thoughts

There are some fundamental metrics to monitor for API performance. Response times, error percentage, and requests per second are key metrics that can give insights into API performance. You can choose tools based on your use case and needs. 

Monitoring APIs in silos can be a good first step, but to debug performance issues quickly you need more context. A tool that can give you further insights into why a particular API didn’t perform well can help engineering teams identify performance bottlenecks faster.

SigNoz provides you with a service-centric view of your top endpoints. You can then visualize the API performance by analyzing all the events that were processed as part of the API call.

You can check out SigNoz Github repo here:
