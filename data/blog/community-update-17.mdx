Welcome back to our monthly product updates - SigNal! So happy to share with everyone that we were trending on the first page of <a href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33049046" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Hacker news</a> over the weekend, and the whole team was so upbeat about it.



![Cover Image](/img/blog/2022/10/signal_17_cover.webp)

Last month, we shipped a lot of dashboard and documentation improvements to make SigNoz better for our users. We also participated in conferences, gave talks on open source, and sipped a lot of coffee!

Let us see what humans of SigNoz were up to in the month of September 2022!

## What we shipped?

We have been working closely with our users to improve the product experience. Based on their feedback, our team worked both on improving our documentation and the product.

[Latest release v0.11.1](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.11.1)

### Dashboard Variables

We have enabled dashboard variables to make monitoring complex things easier. You can define any variable and assign values to it. You can then use the variables in queries while creating dashboards.

For example, you can define a variable for different namespaces in the same cluster and then use just a single graph to monitor all namespaces in the single graph. Check out the PR <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/1557" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

### Search with Trace ID

Observability data is often humongous, and some of our users have traces with hundreds of spans. To make navigating their tracing data easier, we have introduced a search component for Trace ID. You can use any Trace ID to list down all the spans related to that trace. Check out the PR <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/1551" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

### Support for more span attributes

We have enabled support for more span attributes such as arrays (ex: `user.ids:["id1", "id2"]`). Using these span attributes, application owners can get more context out of their tracing data. Check out the PR <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector/pull/14" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

### Documentation Improvement

Documentation is one of the most important touchpoints in our product usage experience. So we have been improving it to help our users comprehend instructions better. Check out our new instrumentation docs on various programming languages:

[Python Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python/)

[Java Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/java/)

[Javascript Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/javascript/)

[Go Instrumentation](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/golang/)

We have also published two new tutorials.

1. [OpenTelemetry binary usage in a virtual machine](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/)
   You can deploy OpenTelemetry binary as agents to collect telemetry data from the same Virtual Machines as your application. Check out the tutorial for instructions:

2. [OpenTelemetry Operator Usage](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-operator-usage/)
   OpenTelemetry operator makes it very easy to set up OpenTelemetry Collector and instrument workloads deployed on Kubernetes. Check out the tutorial for instructions on how to use OpenTelemetry Operator:

{/* <!-- You can use OpenTelemetry receivers to collect K8s infrastructure metrics. Check out this tutorial to learn how to send k8s metrics to SigNoz:

[k8s infra metrics to SigNoz](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/)  --> */}

## What’s upcoming?

Our enterprise features are about to be released soon. The first set of enterprise features includes support for SSO and SAML. SAML and SSO support are essential for our enterprise users to enable smooth team collaboration while maintaining a secure authentication process.

We are also working on performance benchmarks for our logs aggregation to guide our users better in handling logs data at scale.

## Featured Issue

**Deriving more value from Tracing data**

One of our users has created good issues around deriving more value out of tracing data.

<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/1571" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Grouping spans by custom tags</a>

<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/1572" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Dashboards for span queries</a>

Tracing data has many valuable insights that can be utilized to improve application performance. We support advanced querying on tracing data and the ability to run aggregates like p99 latency across service names, HTTP hosts, and methods. We plan to work on features that will help our users debug their applications faster.

If you have more ideas on utilizing tracing data better, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues) to initiate a discussion.

## From the Blog

Distributed tracing helps you track requests across services and understand issues affecting your application performance. In distributed cloud architecture, debugging performance issues is complicated.

Distributed tracing gives visibility to teams on how a user request performs across different services, protocols, and cloud infrastructure. Read our guide on distributed tracing to understand the important concepts and how to implement them within your application
