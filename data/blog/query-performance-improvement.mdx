We cut log-query scanning from ~100% of data blocks to < 1% by reorganizing how logs are stored in ClickHouse. Instead of relying on bloom-filter skip indexes, they generate a deterministic “resource fingerprint” (hash of cluster + namespace + pod, etc.) for every log source and sort the table by this fingerprint in the primary-key ORDER BY clause. This packs logs from the same pod/service contiguously, letting ClickHouse’s sparse primary-key index skip irrelevant blocks. Result: a namespace filter now reads 222/26,135 blocks (0.85 %), slashing I/O and latency while remaining schema-compatible and extensible to AWS, Docker, etc.

Here's how we did it.

## The Problem

When logs come into SigNoz from different pods, services, and environments, they get mixed up in storage. A single data block might contain:

- Some logs from `production`
- Some from `staging`
- Some from `development`
- Random logs from everywhere else

So when you query for logs from a specific namespace, the database can't skip any blocks because every block *might* contain relevant data scattered throughout.

For a simple filter like `namespace = 'production'`, we were scanning 41,498 out of 41,676 data blocks. Essentially reading 99.5% of all data to find logs from one namespace.

## How ClickHouse Stores Data

To understand our solution, you need to know how ClickHouse (our underlying database) organizes data:

**Granules/Blocks**: ClickHouse groups rows into blocks of 8,192 rows each by default (configurable via `index_granularity`). When you query, it decides which entire blocks to read or skip.

**Primary Key Index**: This is a "sparse index" - it doesn't index every row, but rather creates index entries for each block. If your primary key helps identify which blocks contain relevant data, ClickHouse can skip irrelevant blocks entirely.
<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/07/primary-key-index.webp" caption="ClickHouse's sparse primary index with one entry per granule. Source: https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/best-practices/sparse-primary-indexes" />

**Skip Indexes**: Secondary indexes (like bloom filters) that help skip blocks for non-primary key columns. These work, but not as efficiently as the primary key.

**Why This Matters**: ClickHouse is a columnar database optimized for analytical workloads. Unlike row-based databases that read entire rows, ClickHouse reads data in columnar blocks. The efficiency comes from being able to skip entire blocks that don't contain relevant data. The primary key determines the physical storage order, which directly impacts which blocks can be skipped.

**The Physical Layout**: When ClickHouse writes data to disk, it sorts and stores rows according to the `ORDER BY` clause in your table definition. This becomes your primary key for indexing purposes. Rows with similar primary key values are stored physically adjacent to each other in the same blocks.

The key insight: if you can organize your data so the primary key naturally groups related records together, you get much better performance than relying on secondary indexes.

## Our Solution: Hierarchical Resource Fingerprinting

We realized that logs from the same Kubernetes pod always have identical resource attributes. Same cluster, same namespace, same pod name.

Instead of treating these as random metadata, we started creating a "fingerprint" for each resource hierarchy:

```jsx
message = "hello john", cluster = c1, namespace = n1, pod = p1
message = "hello alice", cluster = c1, namespace = n1, pod = p1  
message = "hello bob", cluster = c1, namespace = n1, pod = p2
message = "hello charlie", cluster = c1, namespace = n2, pod = p1
message = "hello david", cluster = c2, namespace = n1, pod = p1
message = "bye john", ec2.tag.env = fn-prod, cloudwatch.log.stream = service1
message = "bye alice", ec2.tag.env = fn-prod, cloudwatch.log.stream = service1
```

```
cluster=c1;namespace=n1;pod=p1;hash=15482603570120227210
cluster=c1;namespace=n1;pod=p2;hash=15182603570120224210  
cluster=c1;namespace=n2;pod=p1;hash=15282603570120223210
cluster=c2;namespace=n1;pod=p1;hash=15382603570120226210
ec2.tag.env=fn-prod;cloudwatch.log.stream=service1;hash=10649409385811604510
```

Then we changed our storage schema to sort by this fingerprint first:

```sql
ORDER BY (
  ts_bucket_start,
  resource_fingerprint,  -- This is the magic
  severity_text,
  timestamp,
  id
)
```

Now all logs from the same resource are stored together physically. When you query for `production` namespace logs, we only read blocks that actually contain production data.

## The Results

Same query, completely different execution:

**Before:** Scanned 41,498 out of 41,676 blocks (**99.5%**)

**After:** Scanned 222 out of 26,135 blocks (**0.85%**)

Here's the actual query execution plan comparison:

### Before

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/07/before-faster-queries.webp" alt="Before faster queries" />
```
Skip Index: bloom_filter (41498/41676 granules)
```
The bloom filter barely helped.

### After

<Figure src="/img/blog/2025/07/after-faster-queries.webp" alt="After faster queries" />
```
PrimaryKey: resource_fingerprint filter (222/26135 granules)
```
The primary key index eliminated 25,913 blocks.

## Implementation Details

The fingerprinting works for any resource hierarchy - Kubernetes pods, Docker containers, AWS services. The algorithm adapts automatically:

- **Kubernetes**: `cluster;namespace;pod`
- **AWS CloudWatch**: `ec2.tag.env;cloudwatch.log.stream`
- **Docker**: `container.name;container.image`

We implemented this as a schema migration while maintaining backward compatibility with existing queries.

## What We Learned

Most log queries filter by resource attributes (which pod, which service, which environment). By organizing data based on actual access patterns rather than just chronological order, we achieved massive performance gains.

Sometimes the biggest wins come from understanding your data layout and optimizing storage accordingly.
