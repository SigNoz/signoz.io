OpenTelemetry and DataDog are both used for monitoring applications. While OpenTelemetry is an open source observability framework, DataDog is a cloud-monitoring SaaS service. OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs that help generate and collect telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces).

OpenTelemetry does not provide a storage and visualization layer, while DataDog does. If you’re using OpenTelemetry, you need an observability backend like SigNoz or DataDog to visualize and store the collected telemetry data.

So why do you need to use OpenTelemetry at all? DataDog provides agents to instrument applications and can be used as an end-to-end solution. But more and more <a href = "https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/why-and-how-ebay-pivoted-to-opentelemetry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >companies</a> are moving to OpenTelemetry for their observability setup. There are many reasons why companies are moving to OpenTelemetry.

## What are OpenTelemetry and Datadog?

**OpenTelemetry** is an open-source observability framework that standardizes the generation, collection, and export of telemetry data. It provides a vendor-neutral approach to instrumentation, allowing you to collect metrics, traces, and logs from your applications and infrastructure.

**Key features of OpenTelemetry include:**

- Standardized data collection across multiple languages and platforms
- Vendor-neutral approach, avoiding lock-in to specific monitoring solutions
- Extensive community support and regular updates

**Datadog**, on the other hand, is a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform that offers a comprehensive suite of tools for application and infrastructure observability. It provides an all-in-one solution for monitoring, logging, and performance analysis.

**Datadog's main offerings include:**

- Infrastructure monitoring
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Log management and analysis
- User experience and synthetic monitoring

## Why use OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the world standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications. Here are some reasons why people prefer OpenTelemetry over native vendor agents:

- **Part of the CNCF landscape**<br></br>
  OpenTelemetry is part of the <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>, so it would work well with other tools in the CNCF landscape. It is the second most active project after Kubernetes.
- **No vendor lock-in**<br></br>
  If you use OpenTelemetry, you can avoid vendor lock-ins with SaaS services. The data collected by OpenTelemetry can be sent to multiple backends. Most observability vendors support the OTLP data format.
- **Future-proof instrumentation**<br></br>
  OpenTelemetry has a wide community working on it to support the instrumentation of a wide range of libraries, frameworks, and languages. If you use an instrumentation SDK from a vendor, you are susceptible to the vendor’s support of emerging technologies.
- **Company knowledge base and easy onboarding**<br></br>
  Using OpenTelemetry, you can have a standard observability setup in place at your company. Over time, the knowledge base will improve, and it will be easier to onboard new members of the observability team. In case the team decides to switch the vendor, it is easy to make configuration changes for the backend.

    <Button className="flex items-center gap-2">Get Started with OpenTelemetry &rarr;</Button>
  </a>
</div>

In an observability stack, the instrumentation layer is most tightly coupled with your application as it involves code changes. Using OpenTelemetry, you can have peace of mind about having standardized observability set up in place.

## Key Differences between OpenTelemetry and DataDog

Let us explore the key differences between OpenTelemetry and Datadog.

### Data Collection

OpenTelemetry uses an open standard for instrumentation, allowing you to collect telemetry data using a consistent format across various services and languages. This approach offers several advantages:

- Flexibility to switch between different monitoring backends
- Consistent data format, regardless of the source
- Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks

Datadog, in contrast, uses proprietary agents and libraries for data collection. While this approach may limit flexibility, it offers benefits such as:

- Seamless integration with Datadog's analytics platform
- Out-of-the-box support for many popular services and technologies
- Simplified setup and configuration process

### Customization and flexibility

OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework, meaning developers can access and customize the source code to meet their specific needs. This makes it easier for developers to integrate OpenTelemetry into their existing systems and workflows.

In contrast, Datadog is a closed-source platform with limited customization options. While it offers a wide range of integrations with other tools and services, it can be more challenging for developers to modify and adapt Datadog to their specific needs. This can be a limiting factor for teams that require a high degree of flexibility and customization in their observability practices.

### Data Storage

OpenTelemetry does not provide any data storage capabilities on its own. Instead, you need to choose an observability backend to store and analyze the telemetry data collected by OpenTelemetry.

In contrast, Datadog provides a comprehensive cloud-based platform that includes built-in data storage capabilities. This means you can use Datadog for data collection and storage, eliminating the need for a separate observability backend.

### Integration with other tools

One of the key advantages of OpenTelemetry is its vendor-neutral approach, which allows users to send data to any observability backend of their choice. This provides users with greater flexibility and the ability to customize their observability stack according to their needs.

On the other hand, DataDog is a closed SaaS platform that provides its own set of APIs and SDKs to collect and analyze telemetry data. While it offers integrations with various third-party tools and services, it is not as flexible as OpenTelemetry.

### Community

OpenTelemetry is a <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >CNCF</a> project, which means it is an open-source project with a thriving community of contributors and users. Community support means that developers can access a wealth of resources, including documentation, tutorials, and support forums, to help them adopt and use OpenTelemetry effectively.

On the other hand, while DataDog offers support to its users, most of it is paid support. This means that developers may have limited resources available to them if they encounter issues or need help using DataDog. However, DataDog offers various paid support options, including phone and email support, as well as a knowledge base and community forums.

Now that we have discussed the differences, it’s time to answer what to choose between OpenTelemetry and DataDog. DataDog also provides support for OpenTelemetry. But the extent of this support is debatable. There has been some recent controversy regarding DataDog’s support of OpenTelemetry codebase.

![/img/blog/2023/02/dd_kills_otel_pr.webp](/img/blog/2023/02/dd_kills_otel_pr.webp)

Since OpenTelemetry does not provide a backend, the question really is to choose between an OpenTelemetry native APM and DataDog.

### Pricing and Cost Considerations

OpenTelemetry is free and open-source, which can be attractive for organizations looking to minimize direct costs. However, it's important to consider the total cost of ownership, including:

- Implementation and maintenance costs
- Backend infrastructure for data storage and analysis
- Potential need for additional tools or services

Datadog uses a subscription-based pricing model with various tiers based on features and data volume. While this can result in higher direct costs, it offers advantages such as:

- Included storage and analysis tools
- Regular updates and new features without additional development effort

When evaluating costs, consider how they will scale with your data volume and infrastructure growth. **OpenTelemetry may offer more control over costs at scale.**
