Welcome to the 25th edition of our monthly product newsletter - SigNal 25! Our team shipped important upgrades to SigNoz, like new trace and logs query builder. We also attended many events and had a small get-together after months.



![Cover Image](/img/blog/2023/06/signal_25_cover.webp)

Let’s dive in to see what humans at SigNoz were up to in the month of May 2023.

## What we shipped?

We have added traces and logs in our query builder. You can find the query builder under the dashboards tab. We also shipped other features based on user feedback.

Latest release - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.20.2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.20.2</a>

Earlier Releases - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.20.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.20.0</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.19.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.19.0</a>

{/* <!-- Note: If you have existing alerts/dashboards data from v0.18.x and prior, you would need to migrate them using migration scripts in v0.19. - [Docs](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/migration/upgrade-0.19/) and see <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector/issues/130" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >SigNoz/signoz-otel-collector#130</a> --> */}

### Trace Query Builder

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2571" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2571</a>

Query builder is now available for traces in SigNoz. Earlier, you could only query trace data with the help of ClickHouse queries, which were a bit complex to use. With query builder, it’s easier to plot charts with a set of dropdowns.

Here’s a quick demo of using the query builder on traces.

### Log Query Builder

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2518</a>

Similarly, query builder is now available for logs data too. You can apply filters like `serviceName` to view logs of a particular service. You can also apply aggregates and groupBy filters.

Here’s a quick demo of using the query builder on logs.

### Query Builder for logs and traces in the Alerts Tab

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2657</a>

Query Builder is also available in the Alerts tab now. You can use the query builder to create alerts on traces and logs data. Here’s a short video showing how you can access it.

### Correlation from logs to trace and vice-versa

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2699" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2699</a>

Correlated telemetry signals can help debug applications quickly. While viewing a particular trace, you can now check the related logs and vice-versa.

### Error rate added in Key Operations table in Services

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2636" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2636</a>

We have added `Error Rate` in the key operations table for services. Error rate is an important metric for key operations in a service, and having it in the table gives our users a quick way to keep a watch on an application’s operations.

### Ability to clone panels in dashboards

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2444" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2444</a>

You can now clone panels in `Dashboards` tab. This feature will help users to start from existing charts and customize on top of them. Here’s a quick video showing how to do it in our dashboards.

### Ability to download logs data and share

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2841" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2841</a>

We have provided the option to download log data in Excel and `csv` format. You can apply specific filters and download log data to share with your team or clients.

### Shareable URLs in Query Builder

Related PR - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/2778" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >#2778</a>

While building customized charts using query builder, you can now share your work in progress with your teammates for them to have a look. Here’s a quick video showcasing how to use this feature:

## Featured Issue

<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/2829" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Allow parsing at query time for logs</a>

We are working on making it easier for our users to parse logs. Log parsing is an important step in log management and helps users organize their logs at scale.

If the log lines have `json` as attributes, can we allow users to only query based on a key in the `json` - even when it was not separated into different attributes during ingestion? If you have more ideas on this, feel free to comment on this <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/2600" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub Issue</a>

### OpenTelemetry End-User Group Discussion

The team at SigNoz facilitates the monthly OpenTelemetry End-user group discussions for the APAC region. The OTel end-user group discussion is a place where you can discuss challenges related to OpenTelemetry implementations and learn from other OpenTelemetry users in a vendor-neutral space.

In our May session, we discussed updates on the OpenTelemetry roadmap and focus areas from Kubecon AMS. We also discussed log ingestion using OTel, tagging spec, and oTel Go SDK, among other topics. You can find the notes from the discussion <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDYC97LfvE428cpIf3A_hSGirdNzglPurlxgKCmw8o4/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>

OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data.

SigNoz uses an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect and process telemetry data before writing it to ClickHouse. Learn more about OpenTelemetry Collector and its capabilities.
