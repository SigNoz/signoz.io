## Final Thoughts: Choosing between FluentD and FluentBit

In conclusion, Fluentd and Fluent Bit are both open-source data collection and logging tools that provide powerful and flexible ways to collect, process, and forward data from various sources to different destinations. They have similar features, such as input/output plugins, extensibility, and filter and transformation capabilities. However, Fluentd is more advanced in terms of routing and buffering capabilities and has a larger community and ecosystem of plugins, while Fluent Bit is more lightweight and well suited for resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems, edge computing and IoT applications, and has a smaller but growing and focused user base.

All in all, Fluent Bit to Fluentd is more like beats to logstash - a lightweight shipper that can be installed as agents on edge hosts or devices in a distributed architecture. For e.g. in a Kubernetes environment, Fluent Bit can be deployed as a DaemonSet on each node to collect and forward data to a centralized Fluentd instance, acting as an aggregator, processing the data, and routing it to different sources based on tags, providing efficient and centralized management of the data collected from all nodes in the cluster. This setup allows for efficient resource utilization and flexibility in routing and processing data. Fluent Bit can be used on its own, of course but has far less to offer in terms of aggregation capabilities and a much smaller amount of plugins for integrating with other solutions.

Once the log data is collected and aggregated, you will need a centralized log management tool to store and analyze the logs. That’s where [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) comes in.
