Welcome to the 28th edition of our monthly product newsletter - SigNal 28! Our team shipped many features and improvements last month. We also had an amazing team workation in Goa, India.

Let’s dive in to see what humans at SigNoz were up to in the month of August 2023.

## What we shipped?

We shipped new features like Apdex score, saved views, live view in new logs explorer, in-context logs and OpsGenie integration in our latest releases. We also shipped a lot of improvements to log management in SigNoz.

Latest release - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.28.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.28.0</a>

Earlier Releases - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.27.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.27.0</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.26.1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.26.1</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.26.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.26.0</a>

### Apdex score

Apdex score is an open standard used to measure user satisfaction with the response time of application services. You can now get an Apdex score for your services in APM charts provided by SigNoz.

### Save View for Explorer Pages

Our new explorer pages for logs now come with an option to `Save View`. You can also share the view with your teammates. Here’s a quick demo of how to use the feature.

### OpsGenie Integration

We are building more alert channel integrations to cover the wide range of use cases of our users. You can now integrate alerts from SigNoz with OpsGenie. Here’s a [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/alerts-management/) on setting up alerts in SigNoz.

### Just-in-time provisioning of SSO users

We have shipped just-in-time provisioning of SSO users for our enterprise customers. With this, our users can automate user account creation when the user first tries to perform SSO.

### Regex support in Explorer Pages

Regex is now supported in the query builder of our new explorer pages. It will help developers write complex queries to search and filter logs and traces.

### Improvements in Logs Management

We shipped improvements to log management in SigNoz.

- With the latest release, you can have the same attributes with multiple data types. For example, `status` can exist as a string with values `ok/fail`, etc., and `status` can exist as int with values `200/202`, etc. (<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/3275" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Related PR</a>)

- Previously, the docker container logs didn’t have `container_name`   by default, because of which it was difficult to filter out logs by a container name. We have added Logspout as the default docker logs collector. Now, the container name is added to the metadata of logs. (<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/3225" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Related PR</a>)

- Check nearby lines of logs with in-context logs. (<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/3190" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Related PR</a>)

- Live view of Logs in Explorer pages. (<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/pull/3170" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Related PR</a>)

We have added a Logs live view on the new Logs Explorer page.

## OpenTelemetry Webinars

At SigNoz, we firmly believe that OpenTelemetry is the bedrock of open-source observability. To help the community understand the benefits of using OpenTelemetry and the right way to implement OpenTelemetry in your application, we have started doing live webinars. The first two of the series are out.

**Getting Started with OpenTelemetry**

Learn how to get started with OpenTelemetry. Some important concepts that are discussed in this webinar:

- What should you instrument first
- Infrastructure metrics
- Where to send data & much more

Check out the entire talk here:

**Gathering data with OpenTelemetry Collector**

In this webinar, we discuss architecting and collecting data with the OpenTelemetry Collector. We discuss using Apache Kafka queues to handle OTLP data, and why you probably shouldn't push OTel data straight to Postgres.

### SigNoz on Jamstack Radio

Jamstack Radio - a Heavybit podcast on building fast and secure applications, invited Pranay to talk about open-source observability with SigNoz.

Check out this interesting talk on \*\*application performance monitoring, insights on utilizing OpenTelemetry, and reasons to consider open-source observability solutions instead of those from SaaS vendors.

## From the blog

This guide is for anyone who is getting started monitoring their application with OpenTelemetry, and is generating unstructured logs.

Structured logs are ideal for post-hoc incident analysis and broad-range querying of your data. However, it’s not always feasible to implement highly structured logging at the code level. Read this guide on how to do log parsing with OpenTelemetry Collector.
