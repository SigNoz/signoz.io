## What is a Log?

A log, in the context of computing and IT, is a record that documents events, actions, transactions, or communications that occur within software applications, operating systems, networks, or other computer systems. These logs are created automatically by the systems or applications to provide a timestamped chronicle of activities.

Application developers also write their own logs to record custom information. To implement custom logging, developers use logging libraries and frameworks appropriate to their programming language and platform. For instance, in Python, the logging module is commonly used, while Java developers might use Log4J or SLF4J.

## What is Log Monitoring - The Fundamentals

Log monitoring is the process of systematically collecting, analyzing, and managing logs generated by computers, applications, and networks. It involves tracking and reviewing these logs to identify and respond to issues, ensure system health, and maintain security.

Some fundamental aspects of log monitoring include:

1. **Log Collection:** Gathering log data from various sources such as servers, network devices, applications, and security systems. This step is crucial for ensuring a comprehensive view of the IT environment.

2. **Log Aggregation:** Consolidating log data from multiple sources into a single, unified format for easier processing and analysis. Aggregation simplifies managing large volumes of log data.

3. **Log Analysis:** Interpreting the collected log data to extract meaningful insights. This involves identifying patterns, anomalies, and trends that could indicate performance issues, security threats, or system malfunctions.

4. **Log Storage:** Securely storing log data for a defined period, balancing the needs of accessibility for analysis and compliance with data retention policies.

5. **Reporting and Visualization:** Creating reports and visualizations from log data to help stakeholders understand the system’s performance, security posture, and other key metrics.

6. **Scalability:** Ensuring the log monitoring system can scale with the growth of the IT infrastructure, handling increased data volumes without loss of performance.

### Different Types of Logs

Logs can be categorized into various types based on their source and purpose. In the realm of cloud-native applications, some common types of logs include:

1. **Application Logs**<br></br>
   Application logs capture information specific to an application. These logs provide insights into user interactions, business logic execution, and application-specific errors. Monitoring application logs is essential for identifying issues affecting user experience and business functionality.

2. **System Logs**<br></br>
   System logs originate from the operating system. They contain information about system-level events, such as hardware status, resource utilization, and system errors. Monitoring system logs is crucial for diagnosing system-level issues and optimizing resource utilization in cloud-native environments.

3. **Infrastructure Logs**<br></br>
   Infrastructure logs encompass logs generated by the underlying infrastructure components, including servers, virtual machines, and network devices. These logs help administrators and DevOps teams monitor the health and performance of infrastructure resources in cloud-native setups.

4. **Security Logs**<br></br>
   Security logs are specialized records within a computer system, network, or application that capture security-related events. Security logs serve as an audit trail for compliance with legal and regulatory standards. They provide evidence of security policy adherence and can be crucial during forensic investigations following a security incident.

### Understanding Log formats

Understanding log format is essential for effective log parsing and analysis. Different log formats structure data in various ways. A clear understanding of the format is crucial for effective parsing and analysis of the log data. Without this understanding, extracting meaningful insights from the logs can be challenging and error-prone.

Some common log formats are:

- **Plain Text**: The simplest form, where logs are written in human-readable text. While easy to read, they can be challenging to parse due to a lack of standard structure.
- **Structured Formats (JSON, XML)**: These formats organize data in a structured manner, making them easier to parse programmatically. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are popular choices.
- **Syslog**: A standard for message logging, widely used in network devices and Unix/Linux systems. It provides a standardized protocol for system log or event messages.
- **Proprietary Formats**: Some systems or applications generate logs in proprietary formats, requiring specific tools or scripts to read and analyze.

## How do I monitor Log Files - A Practical Example

One of the most important use cases in log monitoring is to monitor log files. Instead of theory, let’s go through a quick example of doing it.

Tools involved - SigNoz and OpenTelemetry Collector.

You can either use [SigNoz self-host](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) or [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) for this example. We will showcase this example with the SigNoz cloud.

OpenTelemetry collector is a standalone service provided by OpenTelemetry to collect, process, and export telemetry data. Here’s a full [guide on OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/).

Let’s suppose you have a log file named `app.log` on a virtual machine. Here are the steps to collect logs from that log file and send them to SigNoz.

**Step 1:** Install OpenTelemetry Collector by following this [guide](https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/opentelemetry-binary-usage-in-virtual-machine/).

**Step 2:** While installing the OpenTelemetry Collector, you will create a `config.yaml` file. In that file, add a file log receiver with the following code:

```yaml
 receivers:
  ...
  filelog/app:
    include: [ /tmp/app.log ]
    start_at: end
...
```

`start_at: end` can be removed once you are done testing. The `start_at: end` configuration ensures that only newly added logs are transmitted. If you wish to include historical logs from the file, remember to modify `start_at` to `beginning`.

For parsing logs of different formats, you will have to use operators; you can read more about operators [here](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/logs/#operators-for-parsing-and-manipulating-logs).

For more configurations that are available for filelog receiver, please check [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

**Step 3:** Next, we will modify our pipeline inside `otel-collector-config.yaml` to include the receiver we have created above.

```yaml
service:
    ....
    logs:
        receivers: [otlp, filelog]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
```

**Step 4:** Now, we can restart the Otel collector container so that new changes are applied.

If the above configuration is done properly, you will be able to see your logs in SigNoz UI.

## Choosing the right Log Monitoring Tool

Choosing the right log monitoring tool involves evaluating several key factors to ensure it meets your organization's needs:
