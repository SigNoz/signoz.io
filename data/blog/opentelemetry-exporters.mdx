In modern distributed systems, efficiently collecting, transmitting, and analyzing telemetry data from diverse sources poses a significant challenge. The sheer complexity and scale of these environments require a streamlined solution that can collect and export data from various components seamlessly.

Once you have collected data with OpenTelemetry, OpenTelemetry exporters provide a standardized way to export telemetry data to various backend systems, enabling efficient transmission and analysis and ensuring that data is collected in a consistent format and sent to the appropriate backend for further processing.

This article discusses the need for OpenTelemetry Exporters, the types of OpenTelemetry exporters, and how they can be configured. Before we get into it, let us understand what OpenTelemetry is first.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open-source collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs that aims to standardize the way we generate and collect telemetry data. It follows a specification-driven development. The <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry specification</a>  has design and implementation guidelines for how the instrumentation libraries should be implemented. In addition, it provides client libraries in all the major programming languages that follow the specification.

OpenTelemetry was formed after the merger of two open-source projects - OpenCensus and OpenTracing in 2019. Since then, it has been the go-to open-source standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

The specification is designed into distinct types of telemetry known as signals. Presently, OpenTelemetry has specifications for these three signals:

- Logs
- Metrics and
- Traces

Together, these three signals form the [three pillars of observability](https://signoz.io/blog/three-pillars-of-observability/). OpenTelemetry is the bedrock for setting up an observability framework. The application code is instrumented using OpenTelemetry client libraries, which enables the generation of telemetry data. Once the telemetry data is generated and collected, you need to configure the OpenTelemetry exporter to send data to a backed analysis tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/).

## Why do we need OpenTelemetry Exporters?

OpenTelemetry plays a crucial role in the data collection process, offering invaluable insights into the behavior and performance of applications. However, once this data is acquired, it's important to note that it remains within the application environment and isn't readily available for immediate analysis or further processing.

OpenTelemetry provides exporters, which serve as the conduits for transferring collected data to an OpenTelemetry Collector or a specified backend. This ensures that the data can be effectively utilized for comprehensive analysis, monitoring, and optimization of the application's performance and behavior.

## What are OpenTelemetry Exporters?

An OpenTelemetry Exporter is an OpenTelemetry component responsible for transmitting the collected telemetry data from the application to the chosen backend. These software components are designed to transform code objects, which represent the collected telemetry data, into a format (typically binary or JSON) that's easily storable or transmittable.

Once the telemetry data is converted, the Exporters use standard network protocols like HTTP or gRPC to send the formatted data to its designated destination. This destination may be an OpenTelemetry Collector or any backend system tailored to receive and process this type of data. OpenTelemetry Exporters take charge of communication protocols, data formats, and authentication mechanisms, ensuring a smooth interaction with the backend. This ensures that the telemetry data seamlessly reaches its destination for analysis and interpretation.

In essence, OpenTelemetry Exporters serve as the vital link between the application's internal data structure and the external systems tasked with additional analysis, storage, or monitoring. Without Exporters, the data collected by OpenTelemetry would stay confined within the application, making it inaccessible and underutilized.

## Types of OpenTelemetry Exporters

In this section, we'll look at different types of OpenTelemetry Exporters and their unique capabilities in enhancing observability and data analysis workflows. They are:

- OTLP
- Zipkin
- Jaeger
- OpenCensus

### OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)

OTLP, the native protocol for OpenTelemetry, serves as a library facilitating the standardized transmission of tracing data to an OTLP collector. This lightweight solution seamlessly sends telemetry data to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends. The protocol encompasses encoding, transport, and delivery mechanisms for data exchange between telemetry sources, collectors, and backends.

OTLP employs protocol buffers for efficient telemetry data serialization, utilizing either gRPC or HTTP for transmission. This protocol operates across all nodes in the telemetry data flow, encompassing clients, observability platforms, services, agents, collectors, and forwarders. Its primary objective is to establish a serialization schema aligned with data models, addressing known issues in existing telemetry protocols.

Additionally, it outlines guidelines for implementing both client and server components, covering serialization, data transmission, and response handling.

It is recommended to use the OTLP exporter for any OpenTelemetry setup.

### Zipkin

<a href = "https://zipkin.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Zipkin</a> is a distributed tracing system used for tracking and analyzing how requests move through complex systems, especially in setups with many interconnected services, known as microservices.

OpenTelemetry seamlessly integrates with Zipkin, offering two exporters for integrating trace data collected by OpenTelemetry into Zipkin: the OpenTelemetry Zipkin JSON Exporter and the OpenTelemetry Zipkin Protobuf Exporter.

The <a href = "https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporter/zipkin/zipkin.html#opentelemetry-zipkin-json-exporter/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry Zipkin JSON Exporter</a> simplifies the process of sending [OpenTelemetry traces](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-tracing/) to Zipkin by packaging it in JSON format over HTTP to the designated Zipkin collector endpoint. This exporter supports multiple versions (v1 and v2), giving you more flexibility in how you manage and analyze your traces.

Additionally, the <a href = "https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporter/zipkin/zipkin.html#opentelemetry-zipkin-protobuf-exporter/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry Zipkin Protobuf Exporter</a> efficiently sends traces to Zipkin by transmitting the traces to the designated Zipkin collector endpoint via HTTP, and it supports the efficient v2 protobuf format for trace data.

### Jaeger

<a href = "https://www.jaegertracing.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Jaeger</a> is an open-source, distributed tracing system that monitors and troubleshoots the flow of requests through complex, microservices-based applications, providing a comprehensive view of system interactions.

OpenTelemetry integrates with Jaeger, providing two exporters for sending telemetry data to collected by OpenTelemetry into Jaeger: OpenTelemetry Jaeger Thrift Exporter and OpenTelemetry Jaeger Protobuf Exporter.

The <a href = "https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporter/jaeger/jaeger.html#opentelemetry-jaeger-thrift-exporter/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry Jaeger Thrift Exporter</a> efficiently transmits traces to the designated agent via the Thrift compact protocol over UDP. In cases where deploying the Jaeger Agent alongside an application proves challenging, as in the case of Lambda functions, a collector can be set up to relay spans using Thrift over HTTP. If both the agent and collector are in use, the exporter will exclusively route traces to the collector, avoiding any redundant entries.

The <a href = "https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporter/jaeger/jaeger.html#opentelemetry-jaeger-protobuf-exporter/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry Jaeger Protobuf Exporter</a> operates by sending traces to the designated agent through the efficient Protobuf serialization format facilitated by the high-performance gRPC communication protocol. For instance, in a microservices-based application, if one service makes an API call to another, the Jaeger Protobuf Exporter captures this interaction, converts it into Protobuf format, and sends it via gRPC to the configured agent for further processing and analysis. This ensures rapid and reliable transmission of trace data.

### OpenCensus

OpenCensus was an open-source project, now merged into OpenTelemetry, that provided a set of libraries and instrumentation to enable observability in software systems. Like OpenTelemetry, OpenCensus focused on collecting metrics, traces, and other telemetry data to help developers and operators monitor and troubleshoot their applications.

## Configuring an exporter

In this section, we will see how an exporter can be configured for a Python application with the OTLP Collector or OTLP endpoint.

In order to transmit data to an OTLP endpoint or the OpenTelemetry Collector, the OTLP exporter needs to be configured to the specific endpoint. The endpoint is the specific server or service where the telemetry data will be sent for processing and analysis.

### Install the exporter

The first step is to install the exporter. To do this, run the following command:

```jsx
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
```

### Setup tracing

<Admonition>
The below instructions are only valid for manual instrumentation. If you want to setup auto-instrumentation, please refer to docs [here](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python/).
</Admonition>

Once the exporter has been installed, we can proceed to setting up traces for the application.

```
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Service name is required for most backends
resource = Resource(attributes={
    SERVICE_NAME: "your-service-name"
})

provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://<IP of your Backend>:4317"))
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Merrily go about tracing!
```

The above sets up tracing capabilities using OpenTelemetry. It imports necessary modules, defines a resource with a service name, creates a tracer provider, configures a span processor with an OTLP exporter, and establishes this provider for tracing. It prepares the environment for generating and exporting traces to a specified endpoint.

### Configure metrics collection

```jsx
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.metric_exporter import OTLPMetricExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import PeriodicExportingMetricReader
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import SERVICE_NAME, Resource

# Service name is required for most backends
resource = Resource(attributes={
    SERVICE_NAME: "your-service-name"
})

reader = PeriodicExportingMetricReader(
    OTLPMetricExporter(endpoint="http://<IP of your Backend>:4317")
)
provider = MeterProvider(resource=resource, metric_readers=[reader])
metrics.set_meter_provider(provider)
```

The above configures a metrics collection system using OpenTelemetry. It imports necessary modules, sets up a resource with a service name, creates a periodic metric reader with an OTLP metric exporter, and establishes a meter provider. This prepares the environment for collecting and exporting metrics to a specified endpoint.

### Using HTTP

If you’d prefer to use <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OTLP/HTTP</a> with the binary-encoded protobuf format, you can install the package:

```jsx
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
```

Once the package is installed, replace the import declarations to use the HTTP exporter for tracing with the following:

```jsx
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
```

Finally, update your exporter endpoint if you’re specifying it in code:

```
OTLPSpanExporter((endpoint = "<traces-endpoint>/v1/traces"));
```

<Admonition>
There is not currently an OTLP/HTTP metric exporter.
</Admonition>

Subsequently, you can configure an exporter for Python applications using <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/exporters/#jaeger/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Jaeger</a>, <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/exporters/#zipkin/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Zipkin</a>, and <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/exporters/#prometheus/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Prometheus</a>.

You can also visit the <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry docs</a> to learn how to configure an exporter with other programming languages.
