Containerization is a popular deployment mechanism in today’s ever-changing technology landscape. It has allowed us to easily migrate applications from one platform to another without having to worry about a bunch of OS-specific dependencies. With containerization and a cloud-native approach picking up pace, every cloud provider has come up with solutions to deploy containers in a more native cloud fashion. On AWS, the Elastic Container Service was introduced with the same goal.

## A brief overview of AWS ECS

AWS ECS is the container orchestration platform proprietory to AWS. It simplifies the provisioning of Docker containers using EC2 or Fargate-based computing. With AWS ECS, you can easily deploy containers, autoscale them as well as load balance them using AWS ELB. Thus, it provides a fully integrated solution for deploying, managing, and scaling containers. Although AWS provides a decent amount of metrics related to the service itself, it still does not provide sufficient insights into the actual container metrics themselves. In this article, we try to get deeper into how to monitor the services and tasks on AWS ECS using an OpenTelemetry Collector.

## What is OpenTelemetry Collector?

OpenTelemetry Collector is a stand-alone service provided by OpenTelemetry. It can be used as a telemetry-processing system with a lot of flexible configurations to collect and manage telemetry data.

It can understand different data formats and send it to different backends, making it a versatile tool for building observability solutions.

[Read our complete guide on OpenTelemetry Collector](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-collector-complete-guide/)

## How does OpenTelemetry Collector collect data?

A receiver is how data gets into the OpenTelemetry Collector. Receivers are configured via YAML under the top-level `receivers` tag. There must be at least one enabled receiver for a configuration to be considered valid.

Here’s an example of an `otlp` receiver:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
```

An OTLP receiver can receive data via gRPC or HTTP using the <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/docs/specification.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OTLP</a> format. There are advanced configurations that you can enable via the YAML file.

Here’s a sample configuration for an otlp receiver.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: "localhost:4318"
        cors:
          allowed_origins:
            - http://test.com
            # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
            - https://*.example.com
          allowed_headers:
            - Example-Header
          max_age: 7200
```

You can find more details on advanced configurations <a href = "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >here</a>.

After configuring a receiver, **you must enable it**. Receivers are enabled via pipelines within the service section. A pipeline consists of a set of receivers, processors, and exporters.

The following is an example pipeline configuration:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      exporters: [otlp, prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp, jaeger]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, zipkin]
```

Now that you understand how OpenTelemetry collector collects data let’s see how to collect AWS ECS metrics with it.

## Pre-requisites

For the purpose of this tutorial, you are expected to have at least one working ECS service based on EC2 compute that can be monitored using the OpenTelemetry. You will also need a SigNoz cloud account.

## Setting up SigNoz

You need a backend to which you can send the collected data for monitoring and visualization. [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is an OpenTelemetry-native APM that is well-suited for visualizing OpenTelemetry data.

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign up [here](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

You can also install and self-host SigNoz yourself. Check out the [docs](https://signoz.io/docs/install/) for installing self-host SigNoz.

### Setting up ECS Service

If you do not have a service up and running, you can easily set up a simple NGINX task to run on ECS. To run an NGINX image as an ECS service, follow the below steps:

#### Create Cluster

1. Login to your AWS console
2. Head to the AWS ECS service console
3. Click “Create cluster” and fill out the below details
   1. Cluster name - `MetricsTestCluster`
   2. Infrastructure - Select Amazon EC2 instances
   3. Autoscaling group - Create new
   4. Instance type - `t3.medium` (to allow enough space for the collector and NGINX to run)
   5. Minimum 1 - Maximum 2
   6. Leave the rest of it as default
4. Create cluster

This will create a cluster and register instances, and the cluster will be ready to deploy tasks.

#### Create Task Definition

Next, head to the Task Definitions screen to create a new task definition. Follow the below steps:

1. Create a new task definition
2. Enter task family name: `nginx`
3. Launch type: Amazon EC2 instances
4. Task size: 0.25vCPU and 0.5GB memory
5. Leave the roles empty/defaults
6. Container-1 Name: `nginx` & Image URL: `nginx:latest`
7. Leave the rest as defaults
8. Create Task definition

#### Create Service

Finally, go to the cluster you just created and click “Create Service” in the services tab. Select the task definition you just created - Leave the rest of the options default and create the service.

### Installing AWS CLI

Next, we will require your system to be configured to deploy resources on AWS using AWS CLI. To install AWS CLI on your system, you can follow the instructions provided on <a href = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >this link</a>. It is assumed that you have `AdministratorAccess` to the account to create the required resources. Once you have the above things ready to go, we can proceed to set up the OpenTelemetry collector in ECS.

## Setting up OpenTelemetry Collector

Unlike our previous [tutorials](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-mysql-metrics-monitoring/), we wouldn’t be running OpenTelemetry Collector as a local service on your laptop anymore. In order to monitor ECS containers, we need to run the OpenTelemetry collector on every EC2 instance that is providing compute for ECS. This implies that we need to run the collector as a Daemon service, which creates one task per node.

You can follow [this tutorial](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collecting-ecs-logs-and-metrics/) to install the OpenTelemetry collector as a Daemon service on your ECS. The Cloud Formation template in Step 3 of the linked tutorial creates the below resources:

- Task Definition as Daemon for Opentelemetry Collector
- Service as a Daemon for the OpenTelemetry Collector
- IAM roles required for calling the container insights API

The OpenTelemetry collector config would be as shown below:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:

receivers:
  awscontainerinsightreceiver:
    collection_interval: 30s
    container_orchestrator: ecs
  filelog:
    start_at: beginning
    include_file_path: true
    include:
      - /rootfs/var/log/dmesg
      - /rootfs/var/log/messages
      - /rootfs/var/log/*.log
      - /rootfs/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log
  hostmetrics:
    root_path: /rootfs
    collection_interval: 30s
    scrapers:
      cpu: {}
      load: {}
      memory: {}
      disk: {}
      filesystem: {}
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
  batch/aws:
    timeout: 60s
  resource/aws:
    attributes:
      - key: Timestamp
        action: delete
  resourcedetection:
    detectors:
      - env
      - ec2
      - ecs
      - docker
      - system
    timeout: 2s
    override: false

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
    tls:
      insecure: false
    headers:
      signoz-ingestion-key: "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
  debug:
    verbosity: normal

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/aws:
      receivers: [awscontainerinsightreceiver]
      processors: [resource/aws, batch/aws]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics/host:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs/host:
      receivers: [filelog]
      processors: [resourcedetection, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, logging]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, logging]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, logging]
  extensions: [health_check]
```

This `config` does multiple metrics collection which includes collection of ECS Container insights. The receiver contacts ECS metadata endpoints and internal docker sockets to gather statistics.

To verify that the data is being sent to SigNoz Cloud, you can go to the SigNoz dashboard page and import the dashboards below:

- <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/ecs-infra-metrics/instance-metrics.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >instance-metrics.json</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/hostmetrics/hostmetrics.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >hostmetrics.json</a>

Once imported, select the variables - Cluster name, Autoscaling group, and instance name respectively. You will be able to see the metrics as shown below:

    <figcaption><i>AWS ECS metrics were collected by OpenTelemetry Collector and visualized with SigNoz.</i></figcaption>
</figure>


You can additionally check logs of your service as well using the same configuration as shown below:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img className="box-shadowed-image" src="/img/blog/2023/12/aws_ecs_logs.webp" alt="Logs of AWS ECS collected with OpenTelemetry"/>
    <figcaption><i>Logs of AWS ECS collected with OpenTelemetry Collector shown in SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>


The `resourcedetection` processor takes care of identifying key attributes for the container automatically and allows you to view logs by container name, task defintion arn, service name etc.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you installed an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect AWS ECS metrics and logs and sent the collected data to SigNoz for monitoring and alerts.

Visit our complete guide on OpenTelemetry Collector to learn more about it. OpenTelemetry is quietly becoming the world standard for open-source observability, and by using it, you can have advantages like a single standard for all telemetry signals, no vendor lock-in, etc.

SigNoz is an open-source [OpenTelemetry-native APM](https://signoz.io/blog/opentelemetry-apm/) that can be used as a single backend for all your observability needs.
