## Datadog Pricing 101

Datadog pricing involves two main models: **committed use pricing** and **on-demand pricing**. <br />
Committed use offers lower rates but requires a forecast of your usage in advance, while on-demand pricing is more flexible but generally more expensive.

### Different Pricing Models

Datadog's pricing structure is built around three main models, each tailored to different products and specific monitoring requirements:

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center">
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/2 pr-0 md:pr-4 mb-4 md:mb-0">
    <p><strong>🖥️ &nbsp;Host-Based Pricing</strong>: Used for products like APM and Infrastructure Monitoring, where you're charged per host monitored.</p>

    <p><strong>📊 &nbsp;Volume-Based Pricing</strong>: Applicable for products like logs and synthetics, where you pay based on the volume of data ingested.</p>

    <p><strong>👥 &nbsp;User-Based Pricing</strong>: Active user pricing is applied to products like Incident Management, where the costs depend on the number of active users.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/2">
    <Figure src="/img/blog/2024/10/datadog-pricing-pricing-models.webp" alt="" caption="" className="w-full" />
  </div>
</div>

Before we understand these pricing models in detail, let's first understand the pricing of different products in Datadog

{/* ## Why Datadog Pricing Is Difficult to Understand & Predict

Datadog has a huge fleet of products and sub-products, each with its unique pricing model, which makes it challenging to get a clear understanding of the overall cost. Factors like autoscaling and dynamic workloads further complicate cost predictability.

👉 As your business grows and infrastructure scales, your Datadog bill scales as well, often making it hard to forecast costs.

<div className="ml-2">
Imagine scaling up a new feature only to realize that it drastically increased the volume of metrics collected. A sudden spike from \$200 per month to \$2500 due to unanticipated data ingestion can be a wake-up call to optimize and monitor your observability setup more closely. 
</div>

👉 Developers may not always be aware of the full cost implications, especially when infrastructure changes, making budgeting difficult.

<div className="ml-2">
For instance, a developer might enable detailed logging for troubleshooting but forget to disable it after the issue is resolved, leading to an unexpected spike in log volume and causing costs to soar from \$500 to \$5000 per month. 
</div>

For many developers, cost management isn't just about usage—it's about understanding the broader implications of how and when resources are being used. This can lead to unexpected surprises during billing, particularly when infrastructure changes occur rapidly. */}

## Product-Wise Pricing of Datadog

Now, that we understand the fundamental pricing models used by Datadog, let's dive into the product-wise pricing of Datadog.
We will discuss the pricing of core Datadog products, the value they provide, and the challenges you might face and of course the better alternatives in each case.

### Log Monitoring

<VerticalTabs tabData={{
  "Pricing": (
    <>
      <p>Volume-based pricing, charged per GB of ingested, indexed, and stored logs.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Log Billing Breakdown</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingestion</strong>: Starting at $0.10 per ingested or scanned GB per month (billed annually or $0.10 on-demand). Ingest, process, enrich, live tail, and archive all your logs with out-of-the-box parsing for 200+ log sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Indexing</strong>: $1.70 per million log events per month (billed annually or $2.55 on-demand). Offers 15-day retention for real-time exploration, alerting, and dashboards with mission-critical logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Flex Storage</strong>: Starting at $0.05 per million events stored per month (billed annually or $0.075 on-demand). Flexible long-term retention up to 15 months for historical investigations or security, audit, and compliance use cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Flex Logs Starter</strong>: Starting at $0.60 per million events stored per month (billed annually or $0.90 on-demand). Retention options of 6, 12, or 15 months for long-term log retention without the need to rehydrate.</li>
        <li><strong>Log Forwarding to Custom Destinations</strong>: Starting at $0.25 per GB outbound per destination per month for centralizing log processing, enrichment, and routing to multiple destinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Rehydration</strong>:  Logs stored beyond the initial retention period can be rehydrated if needed at $0.10 per compressed GB scanned, plus the indexing cost for the selected retention period.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Costs are incurred for logs even if they are not actively used, as long as they are processed, stored, or indexed by Datadog.</p>

      <p><strong>Understanding "Million Events"</strong>: In Datadog's pricing model, "million events" refers to the number of individual log entries or records processed. While ingestion is measured in GB, indexing and storage are often priced per million events. This allows for more granular pricing based on the actual number of log entries, rather than just their raw data size. It's important to consider both the volume (GB) and the number of events when estimating costs.</p>

  "Challenges": (
    <ul>
      <li>Log volume can increase unexpectedly, leading to unpredictable costs.</li>
      <li>Retention periods also add to the expense if not managed well.</li>
      <li>The distinction between GB ingested and million events can be confusing when estimating costs.</li>
    </ul>
  ),
  "Solutions": (
    <ul>
      <li>Use log filtering and sampling to reduce the volume of ingested logs.</li>
      <li>Set retention policies that align with your business requirements.</li>
      <li>Monitor both GB ingested and number of events to better predict and manage costs.</li>

  "Common Questions": (
    <>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Can I reduce log ingestion costs without losing critical data?</strong><br />
          Yes, through log filtering and log sampling. Filter out unnecessary logs and sample high-volume log sources to reduce ingestion costs while keeping critical logs for analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What happens if my needs change during my annual commitment?</strong><br />
          You can make adjustments to your plan as your needs evolve. Contact your Datadog sales representative to modify your plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How can I estimate the cost of my usage more accurately?</strong><br />
          Perform a trial period, track log volumes over time, and apply the Datadog pricing model. Datadog provides tools and dashboards to help visualize log volume and estimate monthly costs. Pay attention to both GB ingested and the number of events processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What can I do if my logs exceed the committed ingestion volume?</strong><br />
          You will not lose data or visibility. Datadog bills the additional volume at +50% of the annual price for logs that exceed the commitment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How do I balance between GB ingested and million events in my cost estimation?</strong><br />
          Monitor both metrics closely. Some logs may be small in size but high in number, while others might be larger but fewer. Understanding your log patterns will help you optimize for both ingestion (GB) and indexing/storage (million events) costs.

### APM (Application Performance Monitoring)



<VerticalTabs tabData={{
  "Pricing": (
    <ul>
      <li>Host-based pricing, starting at $31 per host per month (billed annually) or $36 on-demand</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Does trace sampling impact RED metrics?</strong><br />
          No, RED metrics are calculated based on 100% of traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Can I ingest additional spans?</strong><br />
          Yes. Datadog provides a default allocation of 150GB per APM host for Ingested Spans. However, you have the option to ingest additional traces and spans for a 15-minute live trace search and analytics period at a rate of $0.10/GB. It's worth noting that the 150GB allocation is aggregated across all your APM hosts. For instance, if you have two APM hosts where one ingests 250GB and the other ingests 50GB (totaling 300GB), you won't incur any additional charges for ingestion that month as it falls within the combined allocation.

## Understanding Datadog Additional Products Pricing

Another important aspect of Datadog pricing is the add-ons that you can use to enhance your observability stack. Let's go through a detailed breakdown of the pricing structure for Datadog's add-on services, helping you evaluate their value and manage associated costs effectively.

### Custom Metrics Pricing

**Custom Metrics Pricing** is used for adding specific metrics unique to your business across multiple Datadog products.

This pricing model can quickly become complex due to the potential for high cardinality in custom metrics. Here's a detailed breakdown:

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-[auto,1fr] gap-x-4">
  <div className="font-bold">Products</div>
  <div className="mt-4">Infrastructure Monitoring, APM, Logs, and other products that support custom metrics</div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">How It Works</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>Custom metrics are billed based on the number of unique metric-series (cardinality) and tags used. Each unique combination of a metric and its associated tags counts as a separate billable entity.</p>
    <p>For example, if you track response times for different endpoints and add tags like `region` and `environment`, the unique combinations can quickly add up, increasing costs.</p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>🤔 &nbsp; What is a tag?</strong></summary>
      <p>A tag is a label or metadata that you attach to your metrics, logs, or traces to provide additional context and make them easier to organize, filter, and search.</p>
      <p>Tags help you understand the source and meaning of your data. For example, if you are collecting metrics from different servers or services, you can use tags to distinguish between them. By tagging your data, you can group or filter it based on meaningful attributes, such as environment, service, or region.</p>
      <p>Here are some common examples of tags:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Environment</strong>: `env:production`, `env:staging`</li>
        <li><strong>Service</strong>: `service:web-app`, `service:payment-service`</li>
        <li><strong>Region</strong>: `region:us-east-1`, `region:eu-west-1`</li>
        <li><strong>Instance Type</strong>: `instance-type:t2.medium`</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Tags</strong>: You can also create custom tags like `team:frontend`, `feature:experiment-a`</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tags are very useful because they help you answer questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the CPU usage of all servers in the `production` environment?</li>
        <li>How many requests are hitting a particular `service` in the `us-east-1` region?</li>
        <li>Are error rates higher on a specific instance type?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, tags with high cardinality, meaning tags that can have an extremely large number of unique values (e.g., `user_id` or `session_id`), can become problematic. This is because they can lead to a significant increase in the amount of data being stored and processed, leading to higher costs and performance issues.</p>
    </details>
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">Challenges</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>The main issue is the unpredictable nature of high cardinality. Each unique tag combination adds a new metric series, leading to a rapid increase in costs. This makes it challenging to control expenses, especially in complex environments with extensive monitoring needs.</p>
    <p>Additionally, distribution/histogram custom metrics are billed at <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/billing/custom_metrics/?tab=histogram" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">least 5 times higher</a> than Gauges/Counters, further complicating cost management.</p>

  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-2">Optimization Tips</div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    To control costs, limit the use of high-cardinality tags such as user IDs or session IDs. Instead, focus on aggregating data that is meaningful for long-term trends. Regularly audit and remove unused custom metrics that do not add significant value.
  </div>
</div>

### Container Monitoring Pricing

Container Monitoring in Datadog offers comprehensive insights into containerized workloads, enabling teams to proactively manage performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure optimal resource utilization across dynamic environments.

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-[auto,1fr] gap-x-4">
  <div className="font-bold">Products</div>
  <div className="mt-4">Kubernetes Monitoring, Docker Monitoring, and other container-based monitoring solutions</div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">How It Works</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>Datadog charges based on the number of unique containers monitored. Each container, regardless of its lifespan, contributes to the bill. For instance, if you have 100 containers running across multiple clusters, the billing is based on the total number of monitored containers, irrespective of their lifecycle.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">Challenges</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>The main challenge lies in the high dynamicity of container environments, especially in Kubernetes. Containers can be rapidly spun up and down based on load, leading to fluctuating costs. Even ephemeral containers that last only seconds incur costs, which can accumulate over time.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-2">Optimization Tips</div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    To manage costs, monitor only critical containers and set policies to exclude transient or non-essential containers. Using tools like resource quotas and limits can help ensure that container usage remains within a predictable range. Alternatively, consider open-source monitoring tools like Prometheus for less critical workloads, as they can offer more predictable costs.
  </div>
</div>

## How to Optimize Datadog Pricing

Managing Datadog costs effectively is crucial for maintaining budget predictability. Here are key strategies to optimize your expenses:

- Control Custom Metrics and Cardinality: Actively manage custom metrics by eliminating high-cardinality tags, consolidating redundant metrics, and monitoring their usage to avoid unnecessary charges.

- Optimize Log Collection, Indexing, and Retention: Implement log filtering at the source, use exclusion filters for indexing, and adjust retention periods to align with your actual needs. Consider archiving and rehydrating logs instead of continuous hot storage.

- Clean Up Unused Resources: Regularly audit and remove any unused metrics, dashboards, or log pipelines that might be contributing to your bill without providing value.

- Set Up Proactive Billing Alerts: Create cost monitors and usage caps within Datadog to get alerts on potential cost spikes, allowing you to address issues proactively.

    </div>
    <p>
      In 2021, Coinbase faced an enormous $65 million bill from Datadog, largely due to the scaling demands and high observability costs during a boom period for the crypto industry. The high costs prompted Coinbase to evaluate alternatives, leading to the establishment of an in-house observability team. They explored switching from Datadog to a more cost-effective solution using Prometheus, Grafana, and Clickhouse. Despite initial plans to move away from Datadog, Coinbase eventually renegotiated a more favorable deal with Datadog, reducing their future observability expenses significantly while maintaining Datadog's advanced feature set.

## Is Datadog Right for My Organization?
Datadog can be a powerful tool for observability, but its alignment with your organization's stage and needs, particularly regarding cost and control, requires careful consideration.

### Startups
For small startups just getting off the ground, Datadog's free tier can serve as a helpful starting point, offering essential visibility into infrastructure with an easy setup. However, as your infrastructure and traffic begin to grow, costs can escalate rapidly, quickly pushing you beyond the free tier and leading to unexpected bills that are challenging to predict and maintain.

### Medium-Sized Businesses
Medium-sized businesses can leverage Datadog's committed pricing plans, which can help manage costs to some extent by securing lower rates than on-demand usage. The comprehensive platform offers a unified view across various services as your ecosystem expands. 

Despite this, scaling introduces significant complexity and cost unpredictability. Increases in host counts due to autoscaling, unexpected spikes in log volume, and the adoption of additional features like custom metrics can quickly lead to bills that are difficult to forecast and control. Many businesses at this stage struggle with the opaque and rapidly increasing costs that come with dynamic infrastructure.

### Enterprise-Level Organizations
For large enterprises, Datadog offers custom pricing tiers and potential volume discounts, aiming to provide a comprehensive, all-in-one observability solution. Its advanced features, such as AI-based anomaly detection, network performance monitoring, and multi-cloud observability, can be highly attractive for complex environments. 

However, despite custom pricing, enterprise-level scale can still result in extremely high costs, particularly when leveraging Datadog's full suite of advanced capabilities. Furthermore, many enterprises have stringent advanced security and compliance requirements (e.g., data residency, stricter access controls) that may lead them to prefer hosting their observability tools within their own infrastructure or having more direct control over their data, a need that Datadog's SaaS-only model may not fully address for all use cases.


## Why SigNoz is a better alternative to Datadog

OpenTelemetry is now the default standard for generating telemetry data - logs, metrics, traces, or events. Using OpenTelemetry with your applications keeps you free ffrom any vendor lock-in. Datadog provides support for OpenTelemetry, but it does not fully embrace its capabilities. Datadog prefers its own agent to instrument applications, which can lead to vendor lock-in and limits the flexibility of your observability stack.

SigNoz, on the other hand, is built natively on OpenTelemetry, allowing you to leverage the full power of OTel's semantic conventions and data model. This means you can easily switch between different backends or use multiple backends without losing your telemetry data or having to re-instrument your applications. It does not matter whether you are a startup or an enterprise, you should start adopting OpenTelemetry. If you're not convinced, here are all the [reasons](https://signoz.io/why-opentelemetry/) to adopt OpenTelemetry.

We have built SigNoz on top of OpenTelemetry from day 1, providing providing advanced capabilities like [Trace Funnels](https://signoz.io/blog/tracing-funnels-observability-distributed-systems/), [External API monitoring](https://signoz.io/docs/external-api-monitoring/overview/), and out-of-the-box [messaging queue monitoring](https://signoz.io/docs/messaging-queues/overview/) that truly capitalize on OTel data.

Unlike Datadog, which is exclusively cloud-based, SigNoz removes the artificial constraint of a single deployment model, supporting teams across their entire maturity curve and privacy requirements. You can self-host our [Community Edition](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/) if you're just starting and have the capability. For teams scaling fast or preferring managed services, [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/) allows you to focus engineering bandwidth on core business tasks. And for bigger organizations, [SigNoz Enterprise](https://signoz.io/contact-us/) (BYOC or self-hosted with support) caters to specific privacy and data residency needs, offering robust security and compliance features.


{/* ## Understanding Different Datadog Pricing Models

Let's dive deep into each of the pricing models used by Datadog for their various products.

### Host-Based Pricing

**Host-Based Pricing** is used for products like APM and Infrastructure Monitoring. Below, we break down the details of how it works, the challenges it presents, and ways to optimize it effectively:

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-[auto,1fr] gap-x-4">
  <div className="font-bold">Products</div>
  <div className="mt-4">APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, Container Monitoring, Network Performance Monitoring, Serverless Monitoring, Universal Service Monitoring.</div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">How It Works</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>Costs are calculated based on the number of active hosts being monitored at any given time. For example, if you are monitoring 10 hosts, you will be billed for those hosts on an hourly basis throughout the month. If you autoscale during peak periods to 20 hosts, your bill will reflect this higher usage.</p>

    <p className="mt-2"><strong>When You Commit (Hybrid Monthly/Hourly Plan - MHP)</strong>: On a hybrid monthly/hourly plan, Datadog charges a minimum monthly commitment for a set number of hosts. If the number of hosts exceeds this commitment, Datadog charges an additional hourly rate for those extra hosts. This plan can help you save costs if you have predictable host usage with occasional spikes.</p>

    <p className="mt-2"><strong>When You Don't Commit (High Watermark Plan - HWMP)</strong>: On a high watermark plan, the billable count of hosts is calculated at the end of the month using the maximum count (high-water mark) of the lower 99 percent of usage for those hours. Datadog excludes the top 1 percent to reduce the impact of spikes in usage on your bill. This plan can be more flexible but tends to be more expensive if you have frequent and unpredictable spikes in usage.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">Challenges</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>One of the major challenges with host-based pricing is the unpredictability caused by autoscaling. For instance, if you autoscale to meet a traffic spike, your number of active hosts can increase substantially, resulting in a higher bill. This makes it difficult to stick to a budget when your infrastructure is elastic.</p>
    <Figure src="/img/blog/2024/10/datadog-pricing-image.webp" alt="" caption="" className="w-full md:w-3/4 mx-auto" />
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-2">Optimization Tips</div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <p>To mitigate costs, commit to the minimum number of hosts you need under normal operations and use dynamic optimization tools to manage autoscaling efficiently. Another helpful approach is to track and analyze peak usage patterns to better anticipate and plan for cost increases.</p>
  </div>
</div>
    

### Volume-Based Pricing

**Volume-Based Pricing** is used for products such as Logs, Synthetics, APM Ingestion, Database Monitoring, and Observability Pipelines.

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-[auto,1fr] gap-x-4">
  <div className="font-bold">Products</div>
  <div className="mt-4">Logs, Synthetics, APM Ingestion, Database Monitoring, Observability Pipelines</div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">How It Works</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>In volume-based pricing, you are billed based on the amount of data ingested, indexed, and stored in Datadog. This model is often used for data-heavy environments where significant volumes of logs and metrics are produced.</p>

    <p className="mt-2">For example, if your application generates 300 GB of log data, you will incur charges for every gigabyte ingested, indexed, and stored. The more data you process, the higher the cost.</p>

    <p className="mt-2"><strong>Commit to Volume</strong>: Datadog offers the ability to commit to a specific data volume to secure a reduced rate. However, if your usage exceeds the committed volume, any additional data will be billed at the on-demand rate, which is generally higher.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">Challenges</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>Volume-based pricing can lead to unpredictable costs, especially in dynamic environments where log volumes fluctuate. Enabling verbose logging during incidents, for instance, can significantly increase the data ingested, resulting in higher expenses. Developers may unintentionally drive up costs by adding new logs or increasing synthetic API tests without considering the implications.</p>
    <Figure src="/img/blog/2024/10/datadog-pricing-image%201.webp" alt="" caption="" className="w-full md:w-3/4 mx-auto" />
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-2">Optimization Tips</div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Commit Strategically</strong>: Committing to a predictable data volume can save up to 50% compared to on-demand pricing. If you can reasonably forecast your needs, committing is a smart way to lower costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Log Filtering and Sampling</strong>: Reduce data volume by filtering out unnecessary logs or using sampling techniques to ingest only the most relevant logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Quotas and Alerts</strong>: Set quotas on data ingestion and alerts to warn of unusually high log volumes, preventing budget overruns due to unexpected spikes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### User-Based Pricing

**User-Based Pricing** is used for products like Incident Management.

This is probably the easiest to understand pricing model in DataDog, yet it can increase your bill amount quickly if you work in a large org where a lot of folks need access to the product. Here's how it works in more detail:

<div className="md:grid md:grid-cols-[auto,1fr] gap-x-4">
  <div className="font-bold">Products</div>
  <div className="mt-4">Incident Management, CI Pipeline Visibility, Test Visibility</div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">How It Works</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>This model charges based on the number of active users interacting with the product. For example, if your team has five active users managing incidents through Datadog, you will be billed according to the number of users who have access to and interact with the system each month.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-4">Challenges</div>
  <div className="mt-4">
    <p>Costs can quickly rise if more users need access, especially during incidents when cross-functional teams might need to log in simultaneously.</p>
    <Figure src="/img/blog/2024/10/datadog-pricing-image%202.webp" alt="" caption="" className="w-full md:w-3/4 mx-auto" />
  </div>

  <div className="font-bold self-start mt-2">Optimization Tips</div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <ul>
      <li>Limit access to only those who absolutely need it.</li>
      <li>Consider creating shared accounts for certain roles (with careful management) to avoid incurring high costs.</li>
      <li>Review user activity regularly and remove inactive users.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

      question: "Which is better, Splunk or Datadog?",
      answer: "Splunk is known for its powerful log management and analytics capabilities, while Datadog is strong in monitoring and APM. Which is better depends on your use case—if you need extensive log analysis, Splunk may be better. If you need end-to-end observability, Datadog could be more suitable."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Datadog better than Grafana?",
      answer: "Datadog is a more comprehensive observability platform with built-in integrations and analytics, while Grafana is primarily a visualization tool that works well with data sources like Prometheus. Datadog is better if you want an all-in-one solution, whereas Grafana provides more customization and cost control when used with open-source components."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Datadog free for personal use?",
      answer: "Datadog's free tier can be used for personal projects, but it is limited in features and data retention. It is primarily designed to give users a taste of the platform's capabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is Datadog better than Prometheus?",
      answer: "Datadog offers a more complete, out-of-the-box observability experience, including APM, logs, and infrastructure monitoring, without the need for extensive setup. Prometheus is a powerful open-source solution but requires significant configuration and maintenance, which Datadog manages for you."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use Datadog without an agent?",
      answer: "While Datadog relies heavily on agents for collecting metrics, logs, and traces, you can use its API to push custom metrics without an agent. However, this may limit the data you can collect and monitor compared to using the full-featured agents."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Datadog best for?",
      answer: "Datadog is best for comprehensive observability across cloud infrastructure, application performance monitoring, and real-time log analytics. It excels in environments that require unified monitoring and have the budget for its premium features."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Datadog SaaS only?",
      answer: "Yes, Datadog is offered as a SaaS solution. This means you do not need to manage the underlying infrastructure, but it also means you rely on Datadog's pricing and availability."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I save money on Datadog?",
      answer: "To save money on Datadog, consider committed use pricing, reduce log ingestion, manage custom metrics effectively, and limit monitoring to essential hosts and services. Evaluating open-source alternatives like SigNoz can also help manage costs more predictably."
    },
    {
      question: "Are Grafana and Datadog the same?",
      answer: "No, Grafana and Datadog are not the same. Grafana is an open-source visualization and analytics platform that works with various data sources like Prometheus. Datadog is a comprehensive observability platform that includes metrics, traces, and logs. Grafana is more flexible for visualization, while Datadog is an all-in-one observability tool."
