Welcome to the 29th edition of our monthly product newsletter - SigNal 29! We are excited to share important updates from Team SigNoz. We are pleased to announce the public launch of SigNoz cloud. We’ve also raised funding of \$6.5M to fuel the next phase of building and growth.

We also shipped many improvements to the product. Let’s dive in to see what humans at SigNoz were up to in the month of September 2023.

## Launching SigNoz Cloud

We’re excited to announce the public launch of SigNoz Cloud. Many of our users have asked for a fully managed offering of open-source SigNoz, which is now available to everyone. Our cloud service is perfect for anyone who wants to use SigNoz without worrying about hosting and managing their own infrastructure.

You can sign up for a cloud account [here](https://signoz.io/teams/).

## We’ve raised \$6.5M in funding

We’re thrilled to announce that we have raised \$6.5M, led by SignalFire and joined by co-founders of GitHub and PlanetScale as angels.

We believe the future of observability is open-source, and we are on a mission to democratize observability by building the best open-source observability tool based on OpenTelemetry. This funding will help us take SigNoz to the next level. 🚀

We are deeply grateful to our developer community for their continuous support in this journey. 🙏

Read more about our funding [here](https://signoz.io/newsroom/signoz-funding/).

## What we shipped?

We shipped improvements to our logs tab and added capabilities to Metrics Query Builder.

Latest release - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.30.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.30.0</a>

Earlier Releases - <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.29.3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.29.3</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.29.2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.29.2</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.29.1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.29.1</a>

### JSON Filters in the New Logs Explorer

In the new logs explorer, you can query your JSON data present inside the body. JSON data in the body will be rendered like this:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/10/json_filter_1.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

You can click on one of the keys and then filter them out:

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/10/json_filter_2.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

This will help users who send logs in JSON format to SigNoz. You can write complex queries with just a few clicks.

### Save View for logs

We have shipped improvements in the `save views` feature, which comes along with our query builder. While using query builder, you might want to save views after applying a set of filters and share them with your team.

The `save view` feature improves collaboration and makes it easier to access charts quickly.

    <img src="/img/blog/2023/10/save_view_logs.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i>Save view feature in the query builder - it is available in both logs and trace explorer.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Limit and Order By in Metrics Query Builder

We have enhanced the capabilities of the metrics query builder by adding fields such as `Limit` and `Order By`.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/10/query_builder_ft.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i>Limit, order by and having in metrics query builder</i></figcaption>
</figure>

While plotting a chart, you can `Limit` the number of line plots. For example, the below chart having 10 services can be reduced to 4 line plots.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
    <img src="/img/blog/2023/10/qb_plotting_1.webp" alt=""/>
    <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

Apply a `limit` of 4 and hit `Run Query`. You can also apply filters like `Having` to show line plots above a certain threshold.

## OpenTelemetry Webinars

Last month, we had some interesting webinars on OpenTelemetry.

### What is OpenTelemetry API?

This webinar is a gold mine for understanding what’s under the hood of OpenTelemetry. <a href = "https://github.com/srikanthccv" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Srikanth Chekuri</a>, an OpenTelemetry maintainer and contributor, demystifies many concepts in OpenTelemetry and also explains the role of different components in the OpenTelemetry tooling. A few things that are discussed in the webinar:

- OpenTelemetry API and SDK
- OpenTelemetry protocol
- OpenTelemetry Collector
- Under the hood of OpenTelemetry nodejs instrumentation

And much more! Check out the entire talk here:

### Logging in OpenTelemetry

In this webinar, our team member Nitya deep-dived into OpenTelemetry logs. A few things that were discussed:

- How can logs be ingested into OpenTelemetry from existing logging libraries?
- How do logs correlate with traces and metrics in Opentelemetry’s data model?
- Can logs be enriched with additional context such as trace IDs or span IDs?

Check out the full talk here:

## OpenTelemetry Meetup in San Francisco

We are excited to share that we will be hosting an in-person OpenTelemetry meetup in San Francisco on October 4. We will have a couple of speaker talks/panels on topics around observability and OpenTelemetry.

You’re welcome to drop by. Please RSVP here: <a href = "https://lu.ma/lrd71rqh" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >https://lu.ma/lrd71rqh</a>

## SigNoz News

### Trending on GitHub

SigNoz was trending on Github for Typescript. Trending on Github is always a nice feeling for the team, and we are grateful for all the love that the developer community has for open-source SigNoz.

## From the blog

OpenTelemetry is the future of application instrumentation for telemetry data. Most vendors have made announcements of how they’re embracing OpenTelemetry. But are they really committed? We deep-dived into Datadog and New Relic’s support for OpenTelemetry data and found interesting insights. Check it out below.
