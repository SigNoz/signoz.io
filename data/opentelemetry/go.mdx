OpenTelemetry can be used to generate telemetry data from your Golang applications. The collected data can then be sent to an observability tool for storage and visualization. OpenTelemetry is an open-source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([**CNCF**](https://www.cncf.io/)) that aims to standardize the generation and collection of telemetry data.

In this tutorial, we will use OpenTelemetry Golang libraries to instrument a Golang application and then visualize it using an open-source observability tool - [**SigNoz**](https://signoz.io/).

Steps to get started with OpenTelemetry for Go applications:

- [**Creating a SigNoz cloud account**](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/go/#installing-signoz)
- [**Instrumenting a Go application with OpenTelemetry**](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/go/#instrumenting-a-go-application-with-opentelemetry)
- [**Generating telemetry data from your application**](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/go/#generating-telemetry-data-from-your-application)
- [**Monitoring your Go application with SigNoz dashboards**](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/go/#monitor-your-go-application-with-signoz-dashboards)
- [**Adding custom attributes and custom events to spans**](https://signoz.io/opentelemetry/go/#adding-custom-attributes-and-custom-events-to-spans)

## Creating a SigNoz cloud account

SigNoz cloud is the easiest way to run SigNoz. You can sign up [**here**](https://signoz.io/teams/) for a free account and get 30 days of unlimited access to all features.

## Instrumenting your Golang application with OpenTelemetry

Follow the below steps to instrument your Golang application with OpenTelemetry correctly:

**Step 1: Get a sample Golang app from GitHub**

**Prerequisites:** You will need [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) to run the sample application.

The [sample Golang app repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app) contains the boilerplate code that we will instrument.

If you want to follow along with the tutorial, clone the **`without-instrumentation`** branch:

```jsx
git clone -b without-instrumentation https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app.git
```

**Step 2: Install dependencies**

Dependencies related to OpenTelemetry exporter and SDK have to be installed first. Note that we are assuming you are using **`gin`** request router. If you are using other request routers, check out the [**corresponding package**](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-golang/#request-routers).

Run the below commands after navigating to the application source folder:

```go
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk \
  go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/gin-gonic/gin/otelgin \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc
```

**Step 3: Declare environment variables for configuring OpenTelemetry**

Declare the following global variables in the **`main.go`** file after the import block. This will be used to configure OpenTelemetry:

```go
var (
	serviceName  = os.Getenv("SERVICE_NAME")
	collectorURL = os.Getenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT")
	insecure     = os.Getenv("INSECURE_MODE")
)
```

The environment variables used here are explained in detail below to help you configure them correctly.

**Step 4: Instrument your Go application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your application to send data, we will need a function to initialize OpenTelemetry. Add the following snippet of code in your **`main.go`** file:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"os"
	"strings"
	
	.....
	
	"google.golang.org/grpc/credentials"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)
```

Add this after the variable declaration (var) block:

```go
func initTracer() func(context.Context) error {

     var secureOption otlptracegrpc.Option

     if strings.ToLower(insecure) == "false" || insecure == "0" || strings.ToLower(insecure) == "f" {
         secureOption = otlptracegrpc.WithTLSCredentials(credentials.NewClientTLSFromCert(nil, ""))
     } else {
         secureOption = otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()
     }

     exporter, err := otlptrace.New(
         context.Background(),
         otlptracegrpc.NewClient(
             secureOption,
             otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint(collectorURL),
         ),
     )

     if err != nil {
         log.Fatalf("Failed to create exporter: %v", err)
     }
     resources, err := resource.New(
         context.Background(),
         resource.WithAttributes(
             attribute.String("service.name", serviceName),
             attribute.String("library.language", "go"),
         ),
     )
     if err != nil {
         log.Fatalf("Could not set resources: %v", err)
     }

     otel.SetTracerProvider(
         sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
             sdktrace.WithSampler(sdktrace.AlwaysSample()),
             sdktrace.WithBatcher(exporter),
             sdktrace.WithResource(resources),
         ),
     )
     return exporter.Shutdown
 }
```

**Step 5: Initialize the tracer in main.go**

Modify the main function to initialise the tracer in **`main.go`**. Initiate the tracer at the very beginning of our main function.

```go
func main() {
	cleanup := initTracer()
	defer cleanup(context.Background())

	......
}
```

**Step 6: Add the OpenTelemetry Gin middleware**

Configure Gin to use the middleware by adding the following lines in **`main.go`**.

```go
import (
	....
  "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/gin-gonic/gin/otelgin"
)

func main() {
	......
	r.Use(otelgin.Middleware(serviceName))
	......
}
```

This is what your **`main.go`** file should look like after instrumentation:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app/controllers"
	"github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app/models"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	
	"google.golang.org/grpc/credentials"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/gin-gonic/gin/otelgin"
)

var (
	serviceName  = os.Getenv("SERVICE_NAME")
	collectorURL = os.Getenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT")
	insecure     = os.Getenv("INSECURE_MODE")
)

func initTracer() func(context.Context) error {

	var secureOption otlptracegrpc.Option

	if strings.ToLower(insecure) == "false" || insecure == "0" || strings.ToLower(insecure) == "f" {
		secureOption = otlptracegrpc.WithTLSCredentials(credentials.NewClientTLSFromCert(nil, ""))
	} else {
		secureOption = otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()
	}

	exporter, err := otlptrace.New(
		context.Background(),
		otlptracegrpc.NewClient(
			secureOption,
			otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint(collectorURL),
		),
	)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create exporter: %v", err)
	}
	resources, err := resource.New(
		context.Background(),
		resource.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("service.name", serviceName),
			attribute.String("library.language", "go"),
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Could not set resources: %v", err)
	}

	otel.SetTracerProvider(
		sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
			sdktrace.WithSampler(sdktrace.AlwaysSample()),
			sdktrace.WithBatcher(exporter),
			sdktrace.WithResource(resources),
		),
	)
	return exporter.Shutdown
}

func main() {
	cleanup := initTracer()
	defer cleanup(context.Background())
	
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Use(otelgin.Middleware(serviceName))
	models.ConnectDatabase()

	// Routes
	r.GET("/books", controllers.FindBooks)
	r.GET("/books/:id", controllers.FindBook)
	r.POST("/books", controllers.CreateBook)
	r.PATCH("/books/:id", controllers.UpdateBook)
	r.DELETE("/books/:id", controllers.DeleteBook)

	// Run the server
	r.Run(":8090")
}
```

**Step 7: Set environment variables and run your Go Gin application**

Now that you have instrumented your Go Gin application with OpenTelemetry, you need to set some environment variables to send data to SigNoz backend and run your application.

Run the following command to set the environment variables and start the application:

```jsx
SERVICE_NAME=goApp INSECURE_MODE=false OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ-INGESTION-KEY> OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443 go run main.go
```

Where:

- **`SERVICE_NAME`**: `goApp`
    
    This variable defines the name of your application service, which will appear in SigNoz to help identify telemetry data from this specific service. You can name it anything you prefer.
    
- **`INSECURE_MODE`**: `false`
    
    When set to `false`, this ensures that the connection between your application and SigNoz backend is secure (using TLS). It's recommended to keep it as `false` for production environments.
    
- **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`**:
    
    This header contains the SigNoz ingestion key for authentication. Replace `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with your actual [ingestion token](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).
    
- **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`**:
    
    This defines the endpoint where your application will send telemetry data, `ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443`. Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the ingest endpoint will vary according to this table.
    
    | Region | Endpoint |
    | --- | --- |
    | US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
    | IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
    | EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

And congratulations! You have successfully instrumented and started your sample Golang application.

## Generating telemetry data from your application

To ensure that telemetry data is generated and sent to SigNoz, interact with your application by hitting the **`/books`** endpoint of the bookstore app. You can do this by navigating to [**http://localhost:8090/books**](http://localhost:8090/books) in your browser or using a tool like **`curl`** or Postman.

Refresh the endpoint multiple times to simulate load. Wait for 1–2 minutes, and the telemetry data will appear on your SigNoz dashboard, providing insights into your application’s performance.

Alternatively, you can explore the application's functionality by performing CRUD operations. Below are examples to interact with the bookstore app:

1. **Retrieve All Books**

Send a `GET` request to fetch the list of books:

```jsx
curl http://localhost:8090/books
```

Output:

```jsx
{"data":[]}% 
```

Since there are no books yet, the response will be empty.

2. **Create a New Book**

Send a `POST` request to add a new book:

```jsx
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/books \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"Go Programming", "author":"John Doe"}'
```

Output:

```jsx
{"data":[{"id":1,"title":"Go Programming","author":"John Doe"}]}%  
```

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/2024/12/create-book.webp" alt="New book created successfully"/>
<figcaption><i>Book created</i></figcaption>
</figure>

3. **Retrieve a Specific Book**

Send a `GET` request to fetch the details of a specific book by its ID:

```jsx
curl http://localhost:8090/books/1
```

Output:

```json
{"data":{"id":1,"title":"Go Programming","author":"John Doe"}}
```

4. **Update a Book**

Send a `PATCH` request to update the title of the book:

```jsx
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8090/books/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"Updated Title"}'
```

Output:

```jsx
{"data":{"id":1,"title":"Updated Title","author":"John Doe"}}% 
```

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/2024/12/book-updated.webp" alt="Book updated successfully"/>
<figcaption><i>Book updated</i></figcaption>
</figure>

5. **Delete a Book**

Send a `DELETE` request to remove the book by its ID:

```jsx
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8090/books/1
```

Output:

```jsx
{"data":true}% 
```

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/2024/12/book-deleted.webp" alt="Book deleted successfully"/>
<figcaption><i>Book deleted successfully</i></figcaption>
</figure>

By performing these interactions, your application will generate telemetry data, which OpenTelemetry will process and forward to SigNoz for visualization and analysis. Refresh your SigNoz dashboard to observe the metrics, traces, and logs created during these operations!

## Monitor your Go application with SigNoz dashboards

With the above steps, you have instrumented your Go application with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry sends the collected data to SigNoz which can be used to store it and visualize it. Let’s see how SigNoz can help you monitor your Go application.

Navigate to our SigNoz cloud account. On the service page, you should see your **`goGinApp`** service.

<figure data-zoomable align='center'>
<img src="/img/blog/2024/12/services-tab-go.webp" alt="Go app being monitored under services tab"/>
<figcaption><i>Your Go Gin application being monitored on the SigNoz dashboard</i></figcaption>
</figure>

You can monitor application metrics like application latency, requests per second, error percentage, etc. with the **`Metrics`** tab of SigNoz. 

Click on the **`goGinApp`** service and you should be redirected to the metrics page.

<figcaption><i>Monitor your Go Gin application metrics like application latency, requests per second, error percentage, etc.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

OpenTelemetry captures tracing data from your Gin application as well. Tracing data can help you visualize how user requests perform across services in a multi-service application.

In the **`Traces`** tab of SigNoz, you can analyze the tracing data using filters based on tags, status codes, service names, operations, etc.

<img src="/img/blog/2024/12/traces-tab-go.webp" alt="Traces tab"/>
<figcaption><i>Use powerful filters to analyze your tracing data from the Gin application</i></figcaption>
</figure>

You can also visualize your tracing data with the help of [**flamegraphs and Gantt charts**](https://signoz.io/blog/flamegraphs/).

## Adding custom attributes and custom events to spans

In OpenTelemetry, [spans](https://signoz.io/blog/distributed-tracing-span/) represent a single unit of work in a distributed trace. You can enrich these spans with **custom attributes** and **custom events** to capture additional context and insights about the operations your application is performing. This is useful for observability and debugging, as it allows you to track specific details in the trace, providing more valuable insights into your system's behavior.

Here’s how you can add **custom attributes** and **custom events** to spans in your Go application:

**Step 1: Import trace and attribute libraries**

To add attributes and events to spans, you’ll need to import the necessary OpenTelemetry libraries. In your **`controllers/books.go`** file, include the following imports:

```go
import (
	...
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace"
)
```

Where:

- **`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute`**: This package is used to define attributes for spans.
- **`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace`**: This package provides the functionality for managing spans, including adding events and attributes.

**Step 2: Fetch current span from context**

In OpenTelemetry, each span is associated with a request context. To add attributes and events to a span, you first need to fetch the span from the context associated with the incoming request. You can do this by using:

```go
span := trace.SpanFromContext(c.Request.Context())
```

Here, **`c.Request.Context()`** gets the context of the HTTP request, which carries the current span.

**Step 3: Set custom attributes on the Span**

Attributes are key-value pairs that provide additional metadata to a span. You can add custom attributes to the current span using **`span.SetAttributes()`**:

```go
span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("controller", "books"))
```

This adds an attribute **`"controller" = "books"`** to the span, helping you identify which part of the application (in this case, the "books" controller) is responsible for the span.

**Step 4: Add custom events to the span**

Events provide a way to track specific actions or errors within the span’s context. You can add events to a span using **`span.AddEvent()`**:

```go
span.AddEvent("This is a sample event", trace.WithAttributes(attribute.Int("pid", 4328), attribute.String("sampleAttribute", "Test")))
```

In this example, an event named **`"This is a sample event"`** is added to the span, with custom attributes **`"pid" = 4328`** and **`"sampleAttribute" = "Test"`**. These events can help you track specific actions or errors within the span's context.

**Implementation in your `goGin` Application**

In your project folder directory, open the **`controllers/books.go`** file and update it with the following configuration:

```go
package controllers

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app/models"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace"
)

type CreateBookInput struct {
	Title  string `json:"title" binding:"required"`
	Author string `json:"author" binding:"required"`
}

type UpdateBookInput struct {
	Title  string `json:"title"`
	Author string `json:"author"`
}

// GET /books
// Find all books
func FindBooks(c *gin.Context) {
	span := trace.SpanFromContext(c.Request.Context())
	span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("controller", "books"))
	span.AddEvent("Fetching books")

	var books []models.Book
	models.DB.Find(&books)

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"data": books})
}

// GET /books/:id
// Find a book
func FindBook(c *gin.Context) {
	span := trace.SpanFromContext(c.Request.Context())
	span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("controller", "books"))
	span.AddEvent("Fetching single book")

	// Get model if exist
	var book models.Book
	if err := models.DB.Where("id = ?", c.Param("id")).First(&book).Error; err != nil {
		span.AddEvent("Book not found", trace.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("book_id", c.Param("id")),
		))
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": "Record not found!"})
		return
	}

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"data": book})
}

// POST /books
// Create new book
func CreateBook(c *gin.Context) {
	span := trace.SpanFromContext(c.Request.Context())
	span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("controller", "books"))
	span.AddEvent("Creating book")

	// Validate input
	var input CreateBookInput
	if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&input); err != nil {
		span.AddEvent("Book creation failed", trace.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("error", err.Error()),
		))
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
		return
	}

	// Create book
	book := models.Book{Title: input.Title, Author: input.Author}
	models.DB.Create(&book)

	span.AddEvent("Book created", trace.WithAttributes(
		attribute.Int("book_id", int(book.ID)),
	))

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"data": book})
}

// PATCH /books/:id
// Update a book
func UpdateBook(c *gin.Context) {
	span := trace.SpanFromContext(c.Request.Context())
	span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("controller", "books"))
	span.AddEvent("Updating book")

	// Get model if exist
	var book models.Book
	if err := models.DB.Where("id = ?", c.Param("id")).First(&book).Error; err != nil {
		span.AddEvent("Book not found", trace.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("book_id", c.Param("id")),
		))
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": "Record not found!"})
		return
	}

	// Validate input
	var input UpdateBookInput
	if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&input); err != nil {
		span.AddEvent("Book update failed", trace.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("error", err.Error()),
		))
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
		return
	}

	models.DB.Model(&book).Updates(input)

	span.AddEvent("Book updated", trace.WithAttributes(
		attribute.Int("book_id", int(book.ID)),
	))

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"data": book})
}

// DELETE /books/:id
// Delete a book
func DeleteBook(c *gin.Context) {
	span := trace.SpanFromContext(c.Request.Context())
	span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("controller", "books"))
	span.AddEvent("Deleting book")

	// Get model if exist
	var book models.Book
	if err := models.DB.Where("id = ?", c.Param("id")).First(&book).Error; err != nil {
		span.AddEvent("Book not found", trace.WithAttributes(  // Added error event
			attribute.String("book_id", c.Param("id")),
		))
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": "Record not found!"})
		return
	}

	models.DB.Delete(&book)

	span.AddEvent("Book deleted", trace.WithAttributes(  // Added success event
		attribute.Int("book_id", int(book.ID)),
	))

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"data": true})
}
```

Once you've updated your application, restart it and generate new telemetry data. Then, navigate to your SigNoz cloud account and select one of the traces. You should be able to see the custom attributes and events that you've added. These will provide more insights into the activities taking place within your application, improving the observability and debugging process.
