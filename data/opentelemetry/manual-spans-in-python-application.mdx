In the previous tutorials, we set up out-of-the-box tracing, metrics, and logs in our Flask application. 

In this tutorial, we will show you how to manually create spans. Spans are fundamental building blocks of distributed tracing. A single trace in distributed tracing consists of a series of tagged time intervals known as spans. Spans represent a logical unit of work in completing a user request or transaction.

## Why is manual instrumentation useful?

Manual instrumentation is useful because:

- It allows you to create spans at specific points in your code where auto-instrumentation might not provide enough detail.
- With manual instrumentation, you can attach metadata and attributes to spans, providing more context to trace data. This information can include user IDs, transaction types, or other application-specific data, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding user behavior.
- Auto-instrumentation typically covers common frameworks, libraries, and HTTP operations but may lack precision in tracing custom logic or complex interactions. Manual instrumentation gives you full control over where to create spans, allowing you to trace complex workflows and identify bottlenecks with greater accuracy.

Here’s the code repo for this tutorial: [GitHub repo link](https://github.com/SigNoz/opentelemetry-python-example/tree/main/lesson-4)

## Implementing manual instrumentation in Python application

The manual instrumentation involves using the OpenTelemetry SDK to create spans and attach metadata to them. The following code snippets show how to instrument code manually in a Python application.

### Create a Span

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        span.set_attribute("custom_attribute", "custom_value")
        span.set_status(trace.Status.OK)

```

In the above code snippet, we first import the `trace` module from the `opentelemetry` package. We then create a tracer instance using `trace.get_tracer(__name__)`. The `__name__` parameter is used to identify the tracer instance. You can create as number *tracer* instances. You might want to have one tracer instance for a class, module, or a package.

Next, we define a function `my_function()` that creates a span using the `tracer.start_as_current_span()` method. The `start_as_current_span()` method creates a new span and sets it as the current span in the context. The current span can be obtained by calling `trace.get_current_span()`.

Inside the `with` block, we set attributes and status on the span using the <a href="https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/trace.span.html#opentelemetry.trace.span.Span.set_attribute" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">`set_attribute()`</a>, <a href="https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/trace.span.html#opentelemetry.trace.span.Span.set_status" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">`set_status()`</a>, respectively. These methods allow you to attach metadata to the span, and set its status.

### Create a Span (without setting it as the current span)

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    span = tracer.start_span("my_function")
    span.set_attribute("custom_attribute", "custom_value")
    span.set_status(trace.Status.OK)
    span.end()
```

The `start_span` creates a span with the given name. It accepts an optional timestamp, attributes, links, kind, and parent context to use. The `end` must be called if a span is created without a context manager.

### Decorating a function

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

@tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function")
def my_function():
    ...

```

Now, any time the function `my_function` is called, a new span is created. This span can be obtained in the function using `trace.get_current_span()`. The `my_func_span` will be active throughout the function's execution and will be ended after the function is completed.

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

@tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function")
def my_function():
    # Your code goes here
    my_func_span = trace.get_current_span()
    my_func_span.set_attribute("custom_attribute", "custom_value")
    # more code goes here
    my_func_span.set_status(trace.Status.OK)
    # even more code goes here

```

### Create nested spans

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        span.set_attribute("custom_attribute", "custom_value")
        span.set_status(trace.Status.OK)
        # some business logic goes here
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("inner_span") as inner_span:
            inner_span.set_attribute("answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything", 42)
            # some business logic goes here
            with tracer.start_as_current_span("inner_inner_span") as inner_inner_span:
                # some business logic goes here
                inner_inner_span.set_attribute("cities", ["Mumbai", "Hyderabad"])
        # some business logic goes here
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("inner_span_2") as inner_span_2:
            inner_span_2.set_attribute("is_admin", True)

```

In the above code snippet, we create a span `my_function` and two nested spans `inner_span` and `inner_span_2`. The nested spans are created using the `start_as_current_span()` method within the context of the parent span. This creates a hierarchy of spans, where the parent span is the `my_function` span, and the child spans are `inner_span` and `inner_span_2`. The following ASCII chart shows traced information for sample execution.

```bash
my_function (start: 2024-05-19 10:00:00, end: 2024-05-19 10:00:50)
└── my_function (start: 2024-05-19 10:00:00, end: 2024-05-19 10:00:50)
    ├── custom_attribute: custom_value
    ├── status: OK
    ├── inner_span (start: 2024-05-19 10:00:10, end: 2024-05-19 10:00:30)
    │   ├── answer_to_life_the_universe_and_everything: 42
    │   └── inner_inner_span (start: 2024-05-19 10:00:15, end: 2024-05-19 10:00:20)
    │       └── cities: ["Mumbai", "Hyderabad"]
    └── inner_span_2 (start: 2024-05-19 10:00:35, end: 2024-05-19 10:00:45)
        └── is_admin: True

```

### Add metadata and attributes to spans

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        span.set_attribute("custom_attribute", "custom_value")
        span.set_attribute("user_id", 1234)
        span.set_attribute("transaction_type", "payment")

```

Attributes are key-value pairs that provide additional context to spans. In the above code snippet, we set three attributes on the span: `custom_attribute`, `user_id`, and `transaction_type`. These attributes can be used to filter and search for spans in the SigNoz UI. There is a convenient method, `set_attributes`, that accepts a dictionary of key-value pairs.

### Set status on spans

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        span.set_status(trace.Status.ERROR)

```

### Update the span name

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        span.update_name("my_function_updated")

```

### Record events

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        span.add_event("event_name", {"key": "value"})

```

### Record exception

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        try:
            # some code that might raise an exception
            raise Exception("Something went wrong")
        except Exception as e:
            span.record_exception(e)

```

## Step 6: See your Spans in SigNoz

The sample code for lesson 4 has a manual span named `add_task` which gets created whenever you create a new task in the to-do application. To see this span go to the `Traces` tab and apply filters for your application.

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=my-application \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="signoz-ingestion-key=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>" \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
OTEL_PYTHON_LOGGING_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=true \
python lesson-4/app.py

```

Once you run the application and add a task, you will be able to see it in SigNoz.

You can see your span in the trace detail view, too, which shows how the request flowed and how long it took for the `add_task` operation.

## Next Steps

In this tutorial, we configured the Python application to create spans manually. Manual instrumentation gives you more granular control when setting up tracing in your Python application.

In the next tutorial, we will be using OpenTelemetry to generate custom metrics.
